  "detailedSummary": "Life science is the study of living organisms and their interactions with each other and their environment. All living things share certain fundamental characteristics that distinguish them from non-living matter. These include cellular organization, where all organisms are composed of one or more cells that carry out life processes. Metabolism refers to the chemical reactions that occur within cells to maintain life, including the conversion of nutrients into energy and the synthesis of complex molecules. Growth and development are essential life processes where organisms increase in size and complexity over time. Adaptation allows organisms to adjust to their environment through evolutionary changes that enhance survival. Response to stimuli enables organisms to detect and react to changes in their surroundings, such as plants growing toward light or animals fleeing from danger. Reproduction ensures the continuation of species through the production of offspring, either sexually or asexually. These characteristics work together to maintain homeostasis, the stable internal conditions necessary for life. Understanding these fundamental properties helps us classify organisms, study their relationships, and appreciate the diversity of life on Earth. From single-celled bacteria to complex multicellular organisms like humans, all life shares these core characteristics that define what it means to be alive.",
  "whyItMatters": "Understanding the characteristics of life provides the foundation for all biological study and helps us distinguish living organisms from non-living matter, which is essential for scientific classification and understanding the natural world.",

      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "Photosynthesis is a process used by some organisms, but it is not one of the seven universal characteristics of life. All living things must reproduce, respond to stimuli, and carry out metabolism."
