  "summary": "Unravel the secrets of heredity and the genetic code. Learn about DNA structure, replication, transcription, and translation.  Understand Mendelian genetics, Punnett squares, and modern genetic engineering techniques. The lesson includes detailed explanations, visual aids, and assessment tools to ensure mastery of the concepts.\n\nDNA (deoxyribonucleic acid) is the molecule that carries genetic information in all living organisms. It consists of two strands twisted into a double helix, with each strand made up of nucleotides containing a sugar, phosphate group, and one of four nitrogenous bases: adenine (A), thymine (T), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). The bases pair specifically: A with T, and C with G, forming the rungs of the DNA ladder.\n\nGenetics is the study of heredity and how traits are passed from parents to offspring. Gregor Mendel's experiments with pea plants established the fundamental principles of inheritance, including the concepts of dominant and recessive traits, segregation, and independent assortment. These principles are expressed through Punnett squares, which predict the probability of offspring inheriting specific traits.\n\nDNA replication ensures that genetic information is accurately copied when cells divide. The process involves unwinding the double helix, separating the strands, and synthesizing new complementary strands. Gene expression occurs through transcription (DNA to RNA) and translation (RNA to protein), following the central dogma of molecular biology.\n\nModern genetics has expanded to include genetic engineering, where scientists can modify DNA to create organisms with desired traits. This technology has applications in medicine, agriculture, and biotechnology. Understanding genetics helps us comprehend evolution, disease inheritance, and the diversity of life on Earth.",
