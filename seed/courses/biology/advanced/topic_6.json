  "topic": "Neurobiology and Neural Signaling",
  "detailedSummary": "Neurobiology explores the structure and function of the nervous system at molecular, cellular, and systems levels. Neurons are specialized cells that transmit electrical and chemical signals. The neuron consists of a cell body (soma), dendrites that receive signals, and an axon that transmits signals. The resting membrane potential is maintained by ion pumps and channels, creating an electrical gradient. Action potentials are rapid, all-or-nothing electrical signals that propagate along axons. Synaptic transmission involves neurotransmitters released from presynaptic neurons binding to receptors on postsynaptic neurons. Neurotransmitters include excitatory (glutamate) and inhibitory (GABA) types. The central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) processes information, while the peripheral nervous system connects to the body. Different brain regions have specialized functions: the cerebral cortex handles higher cognition, the cerebellum coordinates movement, and the brainstem controls vital functions. Neuroplasticity refers to the brain's ability to reorganize and form new connections. Understanding neurobiology is essential for treating neurological disorders, developing brain-computer interfaces, and understanding cognition and behavior.",
