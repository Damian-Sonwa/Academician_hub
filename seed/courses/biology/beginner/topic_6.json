  "detailedSummary": "The human body consists of multiple organ systems that work together to maintain life. The circulatory system, composed of the heart, blood vessels, and blood, transports oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body. The respiratory system, including the lungs, trachea, and diaphragm, facilitates gas exchange, bringing oxygen into the body and removing carbon dioxide. The digestive system breaks down food into nutrients that can be absorbed, involving organs like the mouth, stomach, intestines, liver, and pancreas. The nervous system coordinates body activities through the brain, spinal cord, and nerves, enabling sensation, thought, and response to stimuli. The immune system protects the body from pathogens and disease through white blood cells, antibodies, and various defense mechanisms. The endocrine system regulates body functions through hormones produced by glands like the pituitary, thyroid, and adrenal glands. The skeletal system provides structure and support, while the muscular system enables movement. The integumentary system (skin) protects the body and regulates temperature. The urinary system filters waste from the blood and maintains water balance. These systems are highly integrated; for example, the circulatory system transports hormones from the endocrine system and carries oxygen from the respiratory system to all body tissues. Understanding how these systems work together is essential for comprehending human health, disease, and medical treatments.",
  "whyItMatters": "Understanding human body systems is crucial for maintaining personal health, understanding how diseases affect the body, and making informed decisions about medical care and lifestyle choices.",

      "question": "Which body system is primarily responsible for transporting oxygen and nutrients throughout the body?",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "Respiratory system",
        "Circulatory system",
        "Digestive system",
        "Nervous system"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The circulatory system, with the heart pumping blood through blood vessels, is responsible for transporting oxygen, nutrients, hormones, and waste products throughout the body."
    },
    {
      "question": "The nervous system and endocrine system both help coordinate body functions, but the nervous system uses electrical signals while the endocrine system uses chemical signals (hormones).",
      "type": "true-false",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "True. The nervous system uses fast electrical impulses through neurons, while the endocrine system uses slower-acting chemical messengers (hormones) released into the bloodstream."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is the main function of the respiratory system?",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "To digest food",
        "To filter waste from blood",
        "To facilitate gas exchange (oxygen in, carbon dioxide out)",
        "To transport nutrients"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 2,
      "explanation": "The respiratory system's main function is gas exchange - bringing oxygen into the body for cellular respiration and removing carbon dioxide waste."
