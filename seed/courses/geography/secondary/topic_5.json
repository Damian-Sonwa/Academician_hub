  "detailedSummary": "Water covers 71% of Earth's surface. Oceans contain 97% of Earth's water and drive global climate through currents. Major ocean currents distribute heat. Rivers flow from source to mouth, creating valleys and deltas. The water cycle circulates water through evaporation, condensation, precipitation, and runoff. Groundwater fills aquifers. Water systems shape landscapes through erosion and deposition. Water resources are essential for life, agriculture, industry, and ecosystems. Understanding water systems is crucial for water management and conservation.",
  "whyItMatters": "Water systems are fundamental to life, climate, agriculture, and ecosystems - understanding them is essential for water resource management and conservation.",
