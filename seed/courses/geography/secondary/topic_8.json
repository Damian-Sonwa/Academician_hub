  "detailedSummary": "Economic geography studies how economic activities are distributed across space. Agriculture types: subsistence (feeding families) and commercial (selling crops). Agricultural systems vary by climate and technology. Industry locations depend on resources, labor, transportation, and markets. Economic sectors: primary (extraction), secondary (manufacturing), tertiary (services), quaternary (information). Trade connects regions through imports and exports. Globalization increases economic interdependence. Economic development varies globally, creating core and peripheral regions. Understanding economic geography explains wealth distribution, trade patterns, and development.",
  "whyItMatters": "Economic geography explains global wealth distribution, trade patterns, and development - essential for understanding economic systems and addressing inequality.",
