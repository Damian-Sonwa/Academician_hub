  "detailedSummary": "Environmental geography studies human-environment interactions and resource management. Natural resources: renewable (solar, wind, water) and non-renewable (fossil fuels, minerals). Resource distribution is uneven globally. Environmental issues: pollution, deforestation, climate change, biodiversity loss. Sustainability balances current needs with future generations. Conservation protects ecosystems. Renewable energy reduces fossil fuel dependence. Environmental policies address pollution and climate change. Sustainable development promotes economic growth with environmental protection. Understanding environmental geography is crucial for addressing global environmental challenges.",
  "whyItMatters": "Environmental geography is essential for understanding resource management, sustainability, and addressing global environmental challenges like climate change.",
