  "topic": "Biomes and Ecosystems: Global Distribution",
  "detailedSummary": "Biomes are large-scale ecosystems with similar climate, vegetation, and wildlife. Major terrestrial biomes: tropical rainforests, deserts, grasslands, temperate forests, taiga, tundra. Aquatic biomes: freshwater (lakes, rivers, wetlands) and marine (oceans, coral reefs). Each biome has characteristic plants, animals, and adaptations. Biome distribution depends on climate, latitude, altitude, and geography. Ecosystems include biotic (living) and abiotic (non-living) components interacting through energy flow and nutrient cycles. Understanding biomes helps explain biodiversity, conservation, and environmental management.",
  "whyItMatters": "Understanding biomes and ecosystems is essential for biodiversity conservation, environmental management, and understanding global environmental patterns.",
