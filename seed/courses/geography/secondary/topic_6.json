  "detailedSummary": "Population geography studies human population distribution, density, growth, and movement. World population is unevenly distributed, concentrated in Asia, Europe, and coastal areas. Population density measures people per area. Population pyramids show age and gender structure. Migration includes push factors (war, poverty) and pull factors (jobs, safety). Types: internal, international, voluntary, forced. Urbanization increases population in cities. Demographic transition model explains population changes. Understanding population geography helps plan services, manage resources, and address migration challenges.",
  "whyItMatters": "Population geography helps understand demographic trends, plan infrastructure, manage resources, and address migration and urbanization challenges.",
