  "detailedSummary": "Cultural geography studies how culture varies across space. Language families group related languages. Major language families: Indo-European, Sino-Tibetan, Afro-Asiatic. Languages spread through migration, trade, and colonization. Religion distribution shows major world religions: Christianity, Islam, Hinduism, Buddhism, Judaism. Religious landscapes include places of worship and sacred sites. Culture includes customs, traditions, arts, and values. Cultural regions share similar characteristics. Cultural diffusion spreads ideas and practices. Globalization affects local cultures. Understanding cultural geography explains diversity, identity, and cultural change.",
  "whyItMatters": "Cultural geography explains human diversity, identity, and cultural patterns - essential for understanding societies and addressing cultural conflicts.",
