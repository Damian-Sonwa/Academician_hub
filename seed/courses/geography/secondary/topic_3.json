  "topic": "Weather and Climate: Atmospheric Processes",
  "detailedSummary": "Weather is short-term atmospheric conditions; climate is long-term patterns. The atmosphere has layers: troposphere (weather), stratosphere (ozone), mesosphere, thermosphere. Solar radiation drives weather through heating, pressure differences, and wind. Water cycle processes include evaporation, condensation, precipitation. Weather systems include high/low pressure, fronts, storms. Climate factors: latitude, altitude, ocean currents, landforms. Climate zones: tropical, temperate, polar. Understanding weather and climate is crucial for agriculture, planning, and climate change.",
  "whyItMatters": "Understanding weather and climate patterns is essential for agriculture, disaster preparedness, urban planning, and addressing climate change impacts.",
