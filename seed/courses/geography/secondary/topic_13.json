  "detailedSummary": "Africa: diverse physical features (Sahara, savannas, rainforests, Great Rift Valley), varied climates, rich resources, rapid population growth, development challenges. Latin America: Andes Mountains, Amazon Basin, diverse climates, cultural mix (indigenous, European, African), economic development varies. Oceania: Australia (desert interior, coastal cities), Pacific Islands (diverse cultures, small populations), New Zealand (mountains, agriculture). These regions face challenges: poverty, environmental issues, political instability, but also have resources, biodiversity, and growing economies. Understanding these regions explains global diversity and development patterns.",
  "whyItMatters": "Understanding these regions explains global diversity, development challenges, and opportunities in Africa, Latin America, and Oceania.",
