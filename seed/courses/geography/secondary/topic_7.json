  "topic": "Urban Geography: Cities and Urbanization",
  "detailedSummary": "Urban geography studies cities, their growth, structure, and functions. Urbanization is the increasing proportion of people living in cities. Cities have zones: central business district (CBD), residential, industrial, commercial. Urban models include concentric zones, sectors, and multiple nuclei. Urban functions: economic, political, cultural, transportation hubs. Challenges: housing, transportation, pollution, inequality. Urban planning addresses these through zoning, infrastructure, and sustainability. Megacities have over 10 million people. Understanding urban geography helps plan sustainable, livable cities.",
  "whyItMatters": "Urban geography is essential for planning sustainable cities, addressing urban challenges, and understanding the majority of humanity who live in urban areas.",
