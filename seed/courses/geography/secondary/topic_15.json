  "detailedSummary": "GIS (Geographic Information Systems) are computer systems for capturing, storing, analyzing, and displaying geographic data. GIS combines maps with databases. Layers represent different features: roads, buildings, elevation, population. GIS functions: mapping, spatial analysis, querying, modeling. Applications: urban planning, disaster management, environmental monitoring, business location. Remote sensing uses satellites and aircraft to collect geographic data. GPS provides location data. GIS helps visualize patterns, analyze relationships, and make informed decisions. Understanding GIS basics is essential for modern geography and spatial analysis.",
  "whyItMatters": "GIS is a powerful tool for spatial analysis, planning, and decision-making - essential for modern geography, urban planning, and environmental management.",
