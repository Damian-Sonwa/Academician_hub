  "topic": "Earth's Structure: Plate Tectonics and Landforms",
  "detailedSummary": "Earth's structure consists of layers: crust, mantle, and core. Plate tectonics explains how Earth's lithosphere is divided into moving plates that interact at boundaries. Convergent boundaries create mountains and trenches. Divergent boundaries form mid-ocean ridges and rift valleys. Transform boundaries cause earthquakes. These processes create landforms: mountains, valleys, plateaus, plains, and coastal features. Understanding plate tectonics explains earthquakes, volcanoes, mountain formation, and continental drift.",
  "whyItMatters": "Plate tectonics explains Earth's dynamic surface, natural hazards, and resource distribution - essential for understanding geology, natural disasters, and Earth's evolution.",
