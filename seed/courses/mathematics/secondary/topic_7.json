  "detailedSummary": "Exponential functions have the form f(x) = aˣ, where a > 0 and a ≠ 1. The base a determines the function's behavior: if a > 1, the function grows exponentially; if 0 < a < 1, it decays exponentially. The natural exponential function uses base e (approximately 2.718), written as eˣ, which has special properties in calculus. Exponential functions model phenomena with constant percentage rates of change: population growth, radioactive decay, compound interest, and viral spread. Key properties include: domain is all real numbers, range is (0, ∞), y-intercept is (0, 1), horizontal asymptote at y = 0, and the function is always increasing (if a > 1) or always decreasing (if 0 < a < 1). Logarithmic functions are the inverse of exponential functions: if y = aˣ, then x = logₐ(y). The common logarithm uses base 10 (log₁₀), and the natural logarithm uses base e (ln). Logarithms have properties that mirror exponentials: logₐ(1) = 0, logₐ(a) = 1, logₐ(xy) = logₐ(x) + logₐ(y), logₐ(x/y) = logₐ(x) - logₐ(y), and logₐ(xⁿ) = n·logₐ(x). These properties enable solving exponential equations by taking logarithms of both sides. Exponential and logarithmic functions are fundamental in modeling growth and decay, analyzing data on logarithmic scales, and solving equations in science, finance, and engineering.",
