  "detailedSummary": "A sequence is an ordered list of numbers following a specific pattern or rule. Each number in a sequence is called a term. Sequences can be defined explicitly (a formula for the nth term) or recursively (each term defined in terms of previous terms). Arithmetic sequences have a constant difference between consecutive terms: aₙ = a₁ + (n-1)d, where a₁ is the first term and d is the common difference. Geometric sequences have a constant ratio between consecutive terms: aₙ = a₁·rⁿ⁻¹, where r is the common ratio. A series is the sum of terms in a sequence. The sum of the first n terms of an arithmetic sequence is Sₙ = n/2 · (a₁ + aₙ) or Sₙ = n/2 · [2a₁ + (n-1)d]. The sum of the first n terms of a geometric sequence is Sₙ = a₁(1 - rⁿ)/(1 - r) when r ≠ 1. An infinite geometric series converges (has a finite sum) when |r| < 1, with sum S = a₁/(1 - r). Sequences and series model many real-world phenomena: population growth (geometric), loan payments (arithmetic), radioactive decay (geometric), and the value of investments over time. They're fundamental in calculus for understanding limits, Taylor series, and the convergence of functions. The Fibonacci sequence, where each term is the sum of the two preceding terms, appears throughout nature in patterns of growth and structure.",
