  "detailedSummary": "Trigonometric functions extend beyond right triangles to model periodic phenomena. The six trigonometric functions (sine, cosine, tangent, cosecant, secant, cotangent) are defined for all angles using the unit circle. These functions are periodic: sine and cosine have period 2π (360°), while tangent and cotangent have period π (180°). Their graphs reveal key characteristics: sine and cosine oscillate between -1 and 1, tangent has vertical asymptotes, and all functions exhibit symmetry properties. Trigonometric identities are equations true for all values of the variable. Fundamental identities include: reciprocal identities (csc = 1/sin, sec = 1/cos, cot = 1/tan), quotient identities (tan = sin/cos, cot = cos/sin), Pythagorean identities (sin²θ + cos²θ = 1, 1 + tan²θ = sec²θ, 1 + cot²θ = csc²θ), and even-odd identities (sin(-θ) = -sin(θ), cos(-θ) = cos(θ)). Angle sum and difference identities enable finding exact values: sin(A ± B) = sin(A)cos(B) ± cos(A)sin(B) and cos(A ± B) = cos(A)cos(B) ∓ sin(A)sin(B). Double-angle and half-angle identities simplify expressions involving 2θ or θ/2. These identities are essential for simplifying expressions, solving trigonometric equations, proving mathematical statements, and analyzing wave behavior in physics, engineering, and signal processing.",
