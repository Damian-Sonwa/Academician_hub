  "detailedSummary": "A function is a relation that assigns exactly one output for each input from a given set. Functions describe how one quantity depends on another. Notation: f(x), where x is input and f(x) is output. Domain: all possible inputs. Range: all possible outputs. Types include linear, quadratic, polynomial, exponential, and logarithmic functions. Key properties: one-to-one (injective), onto (surjective), bijective, even, odd, and periodic. Practical examples: linear f(x) = 3x+2, quadratic f(x) = x^2-4x+3. Graphs, tables, and illustrations help understand function behavior.",
  "whyItMatters": "Functions are the fundamental building blocks of mathematics - understanding their properties is essential for calculus, modeling real-world relationships, and analyzing data.",
