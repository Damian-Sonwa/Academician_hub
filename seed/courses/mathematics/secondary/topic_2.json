  "detailedSummary": "Linear equations and inequalities are fundamental algebraic concepts that model relationships with constant rates of change. A linear equation is an equation where the highest power of the variable is 1, forming a straight line when graphed. The standard form is ax + b = 0, and the slope-intercept form is y = mx + b, where m represents the slope (rate of change) and b is the y-intercept (starting value). Solving linear equations involves isolating the variable using inverse operations: addition/subtraction to move constants, and multiplication/division to eliminate coefficients. Linear inequalities use symbols like <, >, ≤, or ≥ instead of equals signs, representing ranges of solutions rather than single values. When solving inequalities, multiplying or dividing by a negative number reverses the inequality sign—a critical rule that differs from equations. Graphing linear equations reveals their visual representation: every point on the line satisfies the equation. Linear inequalities are graphed as shaded regions, with solid lines for ≤ or ≥ and dashed lines for < or >. These concepts are essential because they model countless real-world situations: calculating costs, predicting trends, analyzing rates of change, and solving optimization problems. From calculating phone bills to predicting population growth, linear relationships are everywhere in mathematics and science.",
