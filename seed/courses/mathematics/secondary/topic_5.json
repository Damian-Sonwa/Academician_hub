  "detailedSummary": "Rational expressions are fractions where both the numerator and denominator are polynomials. Like numerical fractions, rational expressions can be simplified, added, subtracted, multiplied, and divided using similar rules. To simplify a rational expression, factor both numerator and denominator completely, then cancel common factors (but never cancel terms that are added or subtracted). The domain of a rational expression excludes values that make the denominator zero, as division by zero is undefined. Operations with rational expressions follow fraction rules: to add or subtract, find a common denominator (often the least common multiple of the denominators), rewrite each fraction with that denominator, then combine numerators. To multiply, multiply numerators and denominators separately, then simplify. To divide, multiply by the reciprocal of the divisor. Rational equations are equations containing rational expressions. To solve them, multiply both sides by the least common denominator to eliminate fractions, solve the resulting polynomial equation, then check that solutions don't make any denominator zero (extraneous solutions). Rational expressions and equations model many real-world situations including rates (speed = distance/time), work problems, mixture problems, and proportional relationships. They're essential in calculus for understanding limits, derivatives of rational functions, and integration techniques.",
