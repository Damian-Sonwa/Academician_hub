  "topic": "Polynomials and Factoring",
  "detailedSummary": "Polynomials are algebraic expressions consisting of variables raised to non-negative integer powers, combined using addition, subtraction, and multiplication. A polynomial in one variable has the form aₙxⁿ + aₙ₋₁xⁿ⁻¹ + ... + a₁x + a₀, where each aᵢ is a coefficient and n is the degree (the highest power). Polynomials are classified by degree: linear (degree 1), quadratic (degree 2), cubic (degree 3), quartic (degree 4), and so on. Operations with polynomials include addition (combining like terms), subtraction, multiplication (using the distributive property), and division (long division or synthetic division). Factoring is the reverse process of multiplication—expressing a polynomial as a product of simpler polynomials. Common factoring techniques include: factoring out the greatest common factor (GCF), factoring by grouping, factoring trinomials, factoring differences of squares (a² - b² = (a+b)(a-b)), and factoring sums/differences of cubes. The Factor Theorem states that if (x - c) is a factor of polynomial P(x), then P(c) = 0, and vice versa. This connects factoring to finding roots (zeros) of polynomials. Understanding polynomials and factoring is crucial for solving higher-degree equations, simplifying rational expressions, analyzing function behavior, and working with complex algebraic structures. These skills form the foundation for calculus, where polynomials are among the simplest functions to differentiate and integrate.",
