  "detailedSummary": "Coordinate geometry (analytic geometry) combines algebra and geometry by using coordinate systems to represent geometric figures algebraically. The Cartesian coordinate system uses perpendicular axes (x and y) to locate points as ordered pairs (x, y). The distance formula d = √[(x₂-x₁)² + (y₂-y₁)²] finds distances between points. The midpoint formula gives the center point: ((x₁+x₂)/2, (y₁+y₂)/2). The slope formula m = (y₂-y₁)/(x₂-x₁) measures steepness. Lines can be represented in various forms: slope-intercept (y = mx + b), point-slope (y - y₁ = m(x - x₁)), and standard form (Ax + By = C). Parallel lines have equal slopes; perpendicular lines have slopes that are negative reciprocals. Conic sections are curves formed by intersecting a plane with a double cone: circles (plane perpendicular to axis), ellipses (plane at an angle, creating oval shapes), parabolas (plane parallel to one side), and hyperbolas (plane cutting both cones). Each has standard equations: circle (x-h)² + (y-k)² = r²), ellipse (x²/a² + y²/b² = 1), parabola (y = ax² or x = ay²), and hyperbola (x²/a² - y²/b² = 1). These curves model many natural and man-made phenomena: planetary orbits (ellipses), satellite dishes (parabolas), and navigation systems (hyperbolas).",
