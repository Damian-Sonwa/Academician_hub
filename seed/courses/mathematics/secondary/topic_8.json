  "topic": "Trigonometry: Right Triangles and Unit Circle",
  "detailedSummary": "Trigonometry studies relationships between angles and sides of triangles, particularly right triangles. In a right triangle, the three primary trigonometric ratios are: sine (sin) = opposite/hypotenuse, cosine (cos) = adjacent/hypotenuse, and tangent (tan) = opposite/adjacent. These ratios depend only on the angle measure, not the triangle's size. The mnemonic SOH-CAH-TOA helps remember these definitions. For special angles (30°, 45°, 60°), exact values can be determined using special right triangles. The unit circle is a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin, providing a powerful way to extend trigonometry beyond acute angles to all angles. On the unit circle, any point (x, y) corresponds to an angle θ, where cos(θ) = x and sin(θ) = y. This allows defining trigonometric functions for angles greater than 90° and negative angles. The unit circle reveals periodic behavior: sine and cosine functions repeat every 360° (2π radians). Reference angles help find trigonometric values for angles in any quadrant by relating them to acute angles in the first quadrant. The Pythagorean identity sin²(θ) + cos²(θ) = 1 follows directly from the unit circle and the Pythagorean theorem. Understanding right triangle trigonometry and the unit circle is essential for solving problems involving angles, distances, heights, navigation, waves, and circular motion in physics, engineering, and architecture.",
