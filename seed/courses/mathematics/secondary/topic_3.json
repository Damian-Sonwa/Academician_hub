  "detailedSummary": "Quadratic equations are polynomial equations of degree 2, taking the general form ax² + bx + c = 0, where a ≠ 0. These equations model relationships where the rate of change itself changes, creating parabolic curves when graphed. The graph of a quadratic function is a parabola, which opens upward if a > 0 and downward if a < 0. The vertex represents the maximum or minimum point of the parabola, and the axis of symmetry is a vertical line through the vertex. Quadratic equations can be solved using multiple methods: factoring (when the quadratic factors nicely), completing the square (which reveals the vertex form), and the quadratic formula x = (-b ± √(b² - 4ac)) / 2a (which works for all quadratics). The discriminant (b² - 4ac) determines the nature of solutions: positive discriminant means two real solutions, zero means one repeated solution, and negative means two complex solutions. Quadratic functions model numerous real-world phenomena including projectile motion (height of a thrown ball), area optimization (maximizing rectangular areas with fixed perimeters), profit maximization in business, and the shape of satellite dishes and bridges. Understanding quadratics is essential for advanced mathematics, physics, engineering, and economics, as they represent the simplest form of nonlinear relationships.",
