  "detailedSummary": "A system of equations is a collection of two or more equations with the same variables. The solution to a system is the set of values that satisfies all equations simultaneously, representing the point(s) where the graphs intersect. Systems can have one solution (consistent and independent), no solution (inconsistent - parallel lines), or infinitely many solutions (consistent and dependent - same line). For linear systems, common solution methods include: graphing (visual but less precise), substitution (solve one equation for a variable, substitute into the other), elimination (add/subtract equations to eliminate a variable), and matrix methods (for larger systems). Systems of inequalities involve multiple inequalities, with solutions represented as overlapping shaded regions on a graph. The solution region is where all inequalities are satisfied simultaneously. Systems model countless real-world scenarios: mixing solutions with different concentrations, finding break-even points in business, determining optimal resource allocation, solving distance-rate-time problems with multiple vehicles, and analyzing supply and demand in economics. In three dimensions, systems can represent planes intersecting at points, lines, or having no intersection. Understanding systems is crucial for linear algebra, optimization problems, and modeling complex relationships in science and engineering.",
