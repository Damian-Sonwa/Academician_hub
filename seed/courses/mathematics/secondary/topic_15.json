  "detailedSummary": "Calculus is the mathematics of change, studying how quantities vary and accumulate. Limits are the fundamental concept, describing the behavior of functions as inputs approach a particular value. The limit of f(x) as x approaches a, written lim(x→a) f(x), is the value that f(x) gets arbitrarily close to as x gets arbitrarily close to a. Limits can be evaluated by direct substitution, factoring and canceling, rationalizing, or using special limit laws. Continuity means a function has no breaks, jumps, or holes—mathematically, f is continuous at a if lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a). The derivative measures instantaneous rate of change, representing the slope of the tangent line to a curve at a point. The derivative of f(x) at x = a is f'(a) = lim(h→0) [f(a+h) - f(a)]/h. This limit definition gives the slope of the tangent line. Basic derivative rules include: power rule (d/dx[xⁿ] = nxⁿ⁻¹), constant rule, sum/difference rule, product rule, and quotient rule. The derivative has powerful interpretations: velocity is the derivative of position, acceleration is the derivative of velocity, and marginal cost in economics is the derivative of the cost function. Understanding limits and derivatives opens the door to optimization (finding maximums and minimums), related rates, curve sketching, and modeling dynamic systems in physics, engineering, economics, and biology.",
