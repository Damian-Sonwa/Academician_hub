  "detailedSummary": "Probability quantifies uncertainty, measuring the likelihood that an event will occur. The probability of an event E, written P(E), is a number between 0 and 1, where 0 means impossible and 1 means certain. Basic probability rules include: P(E) = number of favorable outcomes / total number of possible outcomes (for equally likely outcomes), the complement rule P(not E) = 1 - P(E), and the addition rule P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B). Conditional probability P(A|B) is the probability of A given that B has occurred. Two events are independent if P(A and B) = P(A)·P(B). Statistics involves collecting, organizing, analyzing, and interpreting data. Descriptive statistics summarize data using measures of center (mean, median, mode) and spread (range, standard deviation, variance). The mean is the average, the median is the middle value, and the mode is the most frequent value. Standard deviation measures how spread out data is from the mean. Probability distributions describe the likelihood of different outcomes. The normal distribution (bell curve) is particularly important, with about 68% of data within one standard deviation of the mean. These concepts are essential for making informed decisions, understanding risk, analyzing data in science and business, and drawing conclusions from experiments and surveys.",
