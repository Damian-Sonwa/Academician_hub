  "topic": "Geometry: Triangles, Circles, and Polygons",
  "detailedSummary": "Geometry studies shapes, sizes, and properties of figures in space. Triangles are three-sided polygons with fundamental properties: the sum of interior angles is always 180°, the triangle inequality states that any side is less than the sum of the other two sides, and triangles are classified by sides (scalene, isosceles, equilateral) and angles (acute, right, obtuse). Special triangles include right triangles (one 90° angle), isosceles triangles (two equal sides), and equilateral triangles (all sides and angles equal). The Pythagorean theorem (a² + b² = c²) applies to right triangles. Circles are sets of points equidistant from a center. Key circle properties include: radius (distance from center to edge), diameter (twice the radius), circumference (C = 2πr or πd), and area (A = πr²). Polygons are closed figures with straight sides. Regular polygons have equal sides and angles. The sum of interior angles of an n-sided polygon is (n-2)·180°. Area formulas vary: rectangle (length × width), triangle (½ × base × height), parallelogram (base × height), trapezoid (½ × (sum of bases) × height), and regular polygon (½ × perimeter × apothem). These geometric concepts are fundamental for understanding space, measurement, design, architecture, engineering, and solving problems involving shapes and their relationships.",
