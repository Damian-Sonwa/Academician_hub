  "topic": "Algebra Fundamentals: Variables, Expressions, and Equations",
  "detailedSummary": "Variables, expressions, and equations form the foundational language of algebra. A variable is a symbol (typically x, y, z, or other letters) representing an unknown or changing quantity. Unlike constants which have fixed values (like 5 or -3), variables can take different values. An algebraic expression combines variables, constants, and operations without an equals sign: examples include 3x + 7, 2a² - 5b + 1, or (x + y)/2. Expressions contain terms (parts separated by + or -), coefficients (numbers multiplying variables, like 3 in 3x), and constants (standalone numbers). An equation is a mathematical statement asserting equality between two expressions, indicated by an equals sign (=). The equation 2x + 5 = 13 means 'twice some number plus five equals thirteen.' Solving equations requires finding the specific value(s) of the variable(s) that make the statement true. The solution process uses inverse operations: addition undoes subtraction, multiplication undoes division. For 2x + 5 = 13, subtract 5 from both sides (2x = 8), then divide by 2 (x = 4). Verification involves substituting the solution back: 2(4) + 5 = 13 confirms correctness. These three concepts—variables representing unknowns, expressions showing relationships, and equations stating equality—are the building blocks enabling all algebraic problem-solving.",
