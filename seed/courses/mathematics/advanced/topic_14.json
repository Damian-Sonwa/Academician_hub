  "detailedSummary": "Mathematical modeling translates real-world problems into mathematical language, enabling analysis, prediction, and optimization. The modeling process involves: identifying variables and parameters, making assumptions, formulating mathematical relationships (equations, functions, systems), solving the model, validating results against data, and refining the model. Models can be deterministic (exact relationships) or stochastic (incorporating randomness). Types include: linear models (proportional relationships), exponential models (constant percentage growth/decay), logistic models (growth with carrying capacity), periodic models (trigonometric functions for cycles), and differential equation models (rates of change). Optimization models find best solutions subject to constraints using calculus, linear programming, or other techniques. Statistical models describe relationships in data using regression (linear, polynomial, exponential). Model validation compares predictions to observed data, assessing goodness of fit using measures like R², residual analysis, and cross-validation. Sensitivity analysis examines how changes in parameters affect outcomes. Applications span all fields: physics (motion, forces, waves), biology (population dynamics, epidemiology), economics (supply/demand, optimization), engineering (design, control systems), medicine (drug dosing, disease spread), and environmental science (climate, pollution). Effective modeling requires balancing simplicity (tractable mathematics) with realism (capturing essential features), and understanding model limitations and assumptions.",
