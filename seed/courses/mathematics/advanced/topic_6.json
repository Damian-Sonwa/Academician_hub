  "detailedSummary": "Linear algebra studies vectors, matrices, and linear systems, which are foundational in mathematics, physics, and computer science. Vectors represent quantities with magnitude and direction. Matrices are arrays of numbers used for linear transformations and solving systems. Systems of linear equations can be solved using substitution, elimination, or matrix methods (Gaussian elimination). Applications include 3D graphics, engineering, machine learning, and network analysis.",
  "whyItMatters": "Linear algebra is fundamental to modern mathematics, physics, computer science, and engineering - essential for understanding linear transformations, solving systems, and applications in machine learning, graphics, and data analysis.",
