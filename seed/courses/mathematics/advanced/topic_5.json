  "topic": "Multivariable Calculus: Partial Derivatives and Multiple Integrals",
  "detailedSummary": "Multivariable calculus deals with functions of more than one variable. Partial derivatives measure how a function changes with respect to one variable while keeping others constant. Multiple integrals allow calculation of volume under surfaces, area, and accumulated quantities in higher dimensions. Applications include optimization in several variables, physics problems (heat, mass), and engineering. Beginners should focus on understanding simple functions of two variables and visualizing surfaces in 3D.",
  "whyItMatters": "Multivariable calculus is essential for modeling real-world phenomena with multiple variables - crucial for physics, engineering, economics, and any field requiring optimization or analysis in higher dimensions.",
