  "topic": "Limits and Continuity",
  "detailedSummary": "Limits describe the value that a function approaches as the input approaches a certain point. Continuity ensures that a function has no breaks, jumps, or holes at a point or over an interval. Understanding limits is essential for derivatives, integrals, and calculus. The limit of f(x) as x approaches a point 'a' is written as lim(x→a) f(x). Continuity at a point 'a' requires three conditions: f(a) is defined, lim(x→a) f(x) exists, and lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a). Types of limits include one-sided limits, infinite limits, and limits at infinity. Examples of continuous functions include polynomials and exponential functions, while piecewise functions may have discontinuities.",
