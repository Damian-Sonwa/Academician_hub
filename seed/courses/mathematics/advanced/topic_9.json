  "detailedSummary": "Graph theory studies **networks of points (nodes)** connected by **lines (edges)** 🌐. Combinatorics is about **counting and arranging things** 🔢. Together, they help solve problems in computer science, social networks, logistics, and scheduling. Graphs can be **directed or undirected**, and combinatorics includes permutations, combinations, and counting principles.",
  "whyItMatters": "Graph theory and combinatorics are essential for computer science, network analysis, and optimization - fundamental for understanding algorithms, social networks, logistics, and discrete problem-solving.",
