  "topic": "Applications of Derivatives: Optimization and Related Rates",
  "detailedSummary": "Derivatives provide powerful tools for solving optimization problems and analyzing rates of change in related quantities. Optimization involves finding maximum or minimum values of functions, which occur at critical points where f'(x) = 0 or f'(x) is undefined. The First Derivative Test determines if critical points are local maxima (f' changes from + to -) or minima (f' changes from - to +). The Second Derivative Test uses concavity: if f''(c) > 0, the point is a local minimum; if f''(c) < 0, it's a local maximum. Absolute extrema on closed intervals are found by evaluating the function at critical points and endpoints. Optimization problems require setting up functions, finding derivatives, and interpreting results in context—applications include maximizing profit, minimizing cost, optimizing area/volume with constraints, and finding optimal dimensions. Related rates problems involve quantities changing together, where one rate is known and another must be found. The chain rule connects these rates: if y = f(x) and x = g(t), then dy/dt = (dy/dx)(dx/dt). Common applications include: expanding/contracting shapes (balloons, shadows), sliding ladders, filling containers, and moving objects. These techniques are essential in engineering design, economics (marginal analysis), physics (motion analysis), and any field requiring optimal solutions or rate analysis.",
