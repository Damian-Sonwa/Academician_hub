  "topic": "Abstract Algebra: Groups, Rings, and Fields",
  "detailedSummary": "Abstract algebra studies algebraic structures with operations satisfying specific axioms. A group is a set G with a binary operation * satisfying: closure (a*b in G), associativity (a*(b*c) = (a*b)*c), identity (exists e such that e*a = a*e = a), and inverses (for each a, exists a⁻¹ such that a*a⁻¹ = e). Groups can be abelian (commutative: a*b = b*a) or non-abelian. Examples include: integers under addition, nonzero reals under multiplication, and symmetry groups of geometric objects. Subgroups are subsets that are groups themselves. Cyclic groups are generated by a single element. A ring is a set with two operations (addition and multiplication) where addition forms an abelian group, multiplication is associative, and distributive laws hold. Examples: integers, polynomials, matrices. A field is a ring where multiplication (except zero) also forms an abelian group. Examples: rational numbers, real numbers, complex numbers, finite fields. Fields enable division (except by zero). Homomorphisms are structure-preserving maps between algebraic structures. Isomorphisms are bijective homomorphisms, showing structures are essentially the same. The Fundamental Theorem of Finite Abelian Groups classifies finite abelian groups. Galois theory connects field extensions to group theory, solving the problem of which polynomial equations are solvable by radicals. Abstract algebra provides foundations for number theory, cryptography (elliptic curves, RSA), coding theory, and modern mathematics.",
