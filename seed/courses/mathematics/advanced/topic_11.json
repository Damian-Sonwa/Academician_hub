  "detailedSummary": "Real analysis provides rigorous foundations for calculus using precise mathematical definitions. Sequences are ordered lists of real numbers {aₙ}. A sequence converges to limit L if, for every ε > 0, there exists N such that |aₙ - L| < ε for all n > N. This formalizes the intuitive idea of 'approaching' a value. Monotone sequences (always increasing or decreasing) converge if bounded. Series are sums of sequences: Σaₙ = a₁ + a₂ + a₃ + ... Convergence tests determine if series have finite sums: comparison test, ratio test, root test, integral test, and alternating series test. Absolute convergence (Σ|aₙ| converges) implies convergence. Continuity is rigorously defined: f is continuous at a if lim(x→a) f(x) = f(a), requiring the limit exists and equals the function value. Uniform continuity strengthens this: for every ε > 0, there exists δ > 0 such that |f(x) - f(y)| < ε whenever |x - y| < δ (same δ works for all x). The Intermediate Value Theorem: if f is continuous on [a, b] and k is between f(a) and f(b), then f(c) = k for some c in (a, b). The Extreme Value Theorem: continuous functions on closed intervals attain maximum and minimum values. Differentiability requires the limit definition of derivative to exist. These rigorous foundations enable proving theorems, understanding convergence, and establishing mathematical certainty in calculus applications.",
