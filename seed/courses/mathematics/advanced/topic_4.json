  "detailedSummary": "A differential equation is an equation that relates a function with its derivatives. It describes how a quantity changes over time or space. Solving a differential equation means finding the function that satisfies the equation. Simple types include: 1) Separable Equations – can be written as dy/dx = g(x)h(y) and solved by integrating both sides, 2) First-Order Linear Equations – of the form dy/dx + P(x)y = Q(x), solved using an integrating factor. Applications include modeling population growth, cooling of objects, motion under gravity, and chemical reactions.",
  "whyItMatters": "Differential equations model dynamic systems in physics, engineering, biology, and economics - essential for understanding how quantities change over time and predicting system behavior.",
