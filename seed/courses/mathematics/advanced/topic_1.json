  "detailedSummary": "Advanced functions and their properties form the foundation of mathematical analysis, topology, and modern mathematics. A function f: A → B is a relation between sets A (domain) and B (codomain) where each element of A maps to exactly one element of B. The rigorous definition requires understanding set theory: f is a subset of A × B such that for every a ∈ A, there exists unique b ∈ B with (a, b) ∈ f. Advanced function properties include injectivity (one-to-one: f(x₁) = f(x₂) implies x₁ = x₂), surjectivity (onto: for every b ∈ B, there exists a ∈ A with f(a) = b), and bijectivity (both injective and surjective, ensuring inverse functions exist). Function composition (f∘g)(x) = f(g(x)) requires careful domain considerations. Advanced topics include: function limits and continuity in metric spaces, uniform continuity, Lipschitz continuity, function spaces (C[a,b], L² spaces), functional analysis concepts, homeomorphisms and isomorphisms, function approximation (Taylor series, Fourier series), and measure-theoretic properties. Special function classes: monotonic functions (strictly increasing/decreasing), convex/concave functions, differentiable functions with advanced derivative properties, integrable functions (Riemann, Lebesgue), and analytic functions. These concepts are essential for real analysis, topology, functional analysis, differential equations, and advanced mathematical modeling.",
