  "topic": "Number Theory: Prime Numbers and Modular Arithmetic",
  "detailedSummary": "Number theory studies properties of integers, particularly prime numbers and divisibility. Prime numbers are integers greater than 1 divisible only by 1 and themselves. The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic states every integer > 1 can be uniquely factored into primes. Prime factorization enables finding greatest common divisors (GCD) and least common multiples (LCM). The Euclidean Algorithm efficiently computes GCD using the property GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a mod b). Modular arithmetic works with remainders: a ≡ b (mod n) means a and b have the same remainder when divided by n. Modular arithmetic has properties: (a + b) mod n = ((a mod n) + (b mod n)) mod n, and similar for multiplication. Modular exponentiation efficiently computes large powers using properties like aᵇ mod n. Fermat's Little Theorem states: if p is prime and GCD(a, p) = 1, then aᵖ⁻¹ ≡ 1 (mod p). The Chinese Remainder Theorem solves systems of congruences. Applications include: cryptography (RSA encryption relies on difficulty of factoring large primes), hash functions, error-correcting codes, and computer science algorithms. Diophantine equations are polynomial equations with integer solutions, like finding integer solutions to ax + by = c. Understanding number theory is essential for cryptography, computer security, algorithm design, and pure mathematical research.",
