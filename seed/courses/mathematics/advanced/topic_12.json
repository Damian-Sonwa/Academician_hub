  "detailedSummary": "Complex numbers extend real numbers by including the imaginary unit i, where i² = -1. A complex number has form z = a + bi, where a is the real part and b is the imaginary part. Complex numbers can be represented geometrically in the complex plane (Argand diagram) as points (a, b) or vectors. Polar form represents z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) = re^(iθ), where r = |z| = √(a² + b²) is the modulus and θ = arg(z) is the argument. Euler's formula e^(iθ) = cos θ + i sin θ connects exponentials and trigonometry. Complex arithmetic: addition (component-wise), multiplication (distribute and use i² = -1), and division (multiply by conjugate). The complex conjugate z̄ = a - bi has property z·z̄ = |z|². Complex functions f: ℂ → ℂ map complex numbers to complex numbers. Key functions include: polynomials, exponentials e^z, trigonometric functions, and logarithms. The complex exponential e^z has period 2πi. Complex differentiation requires the Cauchy-Riemann equations: if f = u + iv is differentiable, then ∂u/∂x = ∂v/∂y and ∂u/∂y = -∂v/∂x. Complex integration uses contour integrals along paths in the complex plane. Cauchy's Theorem states: if f is analytic (differentiable) in a simply connected region, then ∮f(z)dz = 0 for any closed contour. The Residue Theorem evaluates integrals using residues at singularities. Applications include: solving differential equations, evaluating real integrals, signal processing, quantum mechanics, and fluid dynamics.",
