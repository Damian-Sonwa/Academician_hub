  "detailedSummary": "Irregular verbs don't follow standard conjugation patterns and must be memorized. Four essential irregular verbs are 'ser', 'estar', 'tener', and 'hacer'. 'Ser' (to be - permanent) conjugates: soy, eres, es, somos, sois, son. It describes identity, origin, time, and permanent characteristics. 'Estar' (to be - temporary) conjugates: estoy, estás, está, estamos, estáis, están. It describes location, temporary states, and conditions. The ser/estar distinction is crucial: 'Soy médico' (I am a doctor - identity) vs 'Estoy enfermo' (I am sick - temporary state). 'Tener' (to have) conjugates: tengo, tienes, tiene, tenemos, tenéis, tienen. It expresses possession, age ('Tengo veinte años' - I'm 20), and obligations ('Tengo que...' - I have to...). 'Hacer' (to do/make) conjugates: hago, haces, hace, hacemos, hacéis, hacen. It's used for activities and weather ('Hace sol' - It's sunny). These verbs are among the most frequently used in Spanish and mastering them is essential for intermediate communication.",
  "whyItMatters": "These four irregular verbs are among the most common in Spanish - mastering them is essential for expressing identity, location, possession, and actions, which are fundamental to communication.",
