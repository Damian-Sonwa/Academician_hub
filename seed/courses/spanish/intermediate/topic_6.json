  "topic": "Subjunctive Mood: Introduction and Basic Uses",
  "detailedSummary": "The subjunctive expresses doubt, emotion, wishes, and uncertainty. It contrasts with the indicative (facts, certainty). Subjunctive formation: take the 'yo' present form, drop the '-o', add opposite endings: -ar verbs use -e, -es, -e, -emos, -éis, -en; -er/-ir verbs use -a, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, -an. Irregular subjunctives: ser → sea/seas/sea/seamos/seáis/sean, estar → esté/estés/esté/estemos/estéis/estén, tener → tenga/tengas/tenga/tengamos/tengáis/tengan, hacer → haga/hagas/haga/hagamos/hagáis/hagan. Basic uses: after expressions of emotion ('Me alegra que vengas' - I'm glad you're coming), doubt ('Dudo que sea verdad' - I doubt it's true), wishes ('Quiero que estudies' - I want you to study), impersonal expressions ('Es importante que practiques' - It's important that you practice). The subjunctive requires a trigger (verb/expression) and a subject change. Understanding subjunctive enables expressing nuanced thoughts and emotions.",
  "whyItMatters": "The subjunctive is essential for advanced Spanish - it's used constantly in real conversation to express emotions, doubts, wishes, and recommendations, making it crucial for fluent communication.",
