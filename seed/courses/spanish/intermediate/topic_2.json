  "topic": "Past Tense: Preterite and Imperfect",
  "detailedSummary": "Spanish has two past tenses with different uses. The preterite (pretérito) describes completed actions with specific beginnings/ends: 'Ayer comí pizza' (Yesterday I ate pizza). Regular preterite endings: -ar verbs use -é, -aste, -ó, -amos, -asteis, -aron; -er/-ir verbs use -í, -iste, -ió, -imos, -isteis, -ieron. The imperfect (imperfecto) describes ongoing, habitual, or background actions: 'Cuando era niño, jugaba fútbol' (When I was a child, I played soccer). Regular imperfect endings: -ar verbs use -aba, -abas, -aba, -ábamos, -abais, -aban; -er/-ir verbs use -ía, -ías, -ía, -íamos, -íais, -ían. Key differences: preterite = completed, specific time, one-time events; imperfect = ongoing, habitual, background, descriptions. Many sentences use both: 'Mientras estudiaba (imperfect), sonó (preterite) el teléfono' (While I was studying, the phone rang). Common irregular preterites: ser/ir (fui, fuiste, fue, fuimos, fuisteis, fueron), hacer (hice, hiciste, hizo, hicimos, hicisteis, hicieron). Mastering both past tenses enables detailed storytelling and accurate time expression.",
  "whyItMatters": "The preterite and imperfect are essential for talking about the past - understanding their differences enables accurate storytelling and expressing when and how past events occurred.",
