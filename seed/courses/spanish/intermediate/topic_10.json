  "topic": "Reading Comprehension and Writing Practice",
  "detailedSummary": "Reading and writing practice integrates all grammar and vocabulary learned. Reading strategies: identify main ideas, use context clues, recognize cognates (words similar to English), break down complex sentences. Writing practice: start with simple sentences, build to paragraphs, use connectors (y, pero, porque, sin embargo, además), vary sentence structure, check grammar and spelling. Common writing topics: describing daily routines, narrating past events, expressing opinions, writing emails/letters, summarizing stories. Reading materials: news articles, short stories, blogs, social media posts, advertisements. Writing formats: emails ('Estimado/a...' - Dear...), postcards ('Querido/a...' - Dear...), descriptions, narratives. Practice activities: reading comprehension questions, writing summaries, creative writing, translation exercises. Regular reading expands vocabulary and exposes you to natural language patterns. Writing reinforces grammar and helps internalize structures. Both skills complement speaking and listening for well-rounded language proficiency.",
  "whyItMatters": "Reading and writing are essential for language mastery - they reinforce grammar, expand vocabulary, and enable you to communicate in written form, which is crucial for academic and professional contexts.",
