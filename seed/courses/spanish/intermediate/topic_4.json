Common reflexive verbs: levantarse (to get up), ducharse (to shower), vestirse (to get dressed), despertarse (to wake up), acostarse (to go to bed), lavarse (to wash oneself), peinarse (to comb one's hair), cepillarse (to brush), afeitarse (to shave). Conjugation: 'Me levanto' (I get up), 'Te duchas' (You shower), 'Se viste' (He/She gets dressed). Daily routine vocabulary: por la mañana (in the morning), por la tarde (in the afternoon), por la noche (at night), primero (first), luego (then), después (after), finalmente (finally). Example routine: 'Me despierto a las siete, me ducho, me visto, y desayuno' (I wake up at seven, shower, get dressed, and have breakfast). Some verbs can be reflexive or non-reflexive: 'lavo el coche' (I wash the car) vs 'me lavo' (I wash myself). Understanding reflexive verbs enables describing daily activities and routines accurately.",
  "whyItMatters": "Reflexive verbs are essential for describing daily routines and personal care activities - they're used constantly in conversation about everyday life.",
