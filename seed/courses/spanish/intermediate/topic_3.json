  "topic": "Future Tense and Conditional",
  "detailedSummary": "The future tense expresses actions that will happen. Regular future endings are added to the infinitive: -é, -ás, -á, -emos, -éis, -án. Examples: 'hablaré' (I will speak), 'comerás' (you will eat), 'viviremos' (we will live). Irregular futures have stem changes: tener → tendré, hacer → haré, decir → diré, poder → podré, querer → querré, saber → sabré, venir → vendré, salir → saldré, poner → pondré. The conditional expresses 'would' actions and polite requests. Regular conditional endings: -ía, -ías, -ía, -íamos, -íais, -ían. Examples: 'hablaría' (I would speak), 'comerías' (you would eat). Irregular conditionals use the same stems as irregular futures: tendría, haría, diría, etc. Uses: future for predictions ('Lloverá mañana' - It will rain tomorrow), plans ('Viajaré a España' - I will travel to Spain); conditional for hypotheticals ('Comería pizza si tuviera hambre' - I would eat pizza if I were hungry), polite requests ('¿Podrías ayudarme?' - Could you help me?). Both tenses enable expressing future plans and hypothetical situations.",
  "whyItMatters": "Future and conditional tenses are essential for expressing plans, predictions, and hypothetical situations - mastering them enables advanced communication about possibilities and future events.",
