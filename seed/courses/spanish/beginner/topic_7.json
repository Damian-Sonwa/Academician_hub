  "topic": "Asking Questions and Basic Conversation",
  "detailedSummary": "Asking questions is fundamental to communication. Spanish uses question words (interrogatives) and inverted question marks (¿?). Question words include: ¿Qué? (What?), ¿Quién?/¿Quiénes? (Who?), ¿Dónde? (Where?), ¿Cuándo? (When?), ¿Por qué? (Why?), ¿Cómo? (How?), ¿Cuánto?/¿Cuánta?/¿Cuántos?/¿Cuántas? (How much/many?), ¿Cuál?/¿Cuáles? (Which?). Yes/no questions can be formed by intonation (raising voice at end) or by adding '¿' at the beginning. Common question structures: '¿Dónde está...?' (Where is...?), '¿Cómo se llama...?' (What is...called?), '¿Cuánto cuesta...?' (How much does...cost?), '¿Qué hora es?' (What time is it?). Basic conversation phrases: '¿Hablas inglés?' (Do you speak English?), 'No entiendo' (I don't understand), '¿Puede repetir?' (Can you repeat?), 'Hablo un poco de español' (I speak a little Spanish), 'Más despacio, por favor' (Slower, please). Understanding question formation enables you to gather information, navigate situations, and engage in meaningful conversations.",
