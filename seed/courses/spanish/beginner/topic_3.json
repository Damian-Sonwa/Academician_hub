  "detailedSummary": "Numbers are essential for everyday communication in Spanish. Learning numbers 0-100 provides a solid foundation for counting, telling time, discussing prices, and expressing quantities. Numbers 0-15 are unique: cero (0), uno (1), dos (2), tres (3), cuatro (4), cinco (5), seis (6), siete (7), ocho (8), nueve (9), diez (10), once (11), doce (12), trece (13), catorce (14), quince (15). Numbers 16-19 combine 'diez' with the unit: dieciséis (16), diecisiete (17), dieciocho (18), diecinueve (19). Multiples of ten are: veinte (20), treinta (30), cuarenta (40), cincuenta (50), sesenta (60), setenta (70), ochenta (80), noventa (90), cien (100). Numbers 21-99 combine tens and units with 'y' (and): veintiuno (21), treinta y dos (32), cuarenta y cinco (45). Note: 'uno' becomes 'un' before masculine nouns. Numbers are used for telling time, dates, prices, ages, and quantities. Practice with real-world contexts like shopping, scheduling, and describing quantities helps reinforce learning.",
  "whyItMatters": "Numbers are used constantly in daily life - from telling time and dates to shopping and scheduling, mastering numbers 0-100 is essential for basic Spanish communication.",
