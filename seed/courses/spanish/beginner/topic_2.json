  "topic": "The Spanish Alphabet and Pronunciation",
  "detailedSummary": "The Spanish alphabet consists of 27 letters, including the 26 letters of the English alphabet plus 'ñ' (eñe). Unlike English, Spanish has consistent pronunciation rules, making it easier to read once you learn the sounds. Each letter typically has one sound. Vowels (a, e, i, o, u) are pure and consistent: 'a' sounds like 'ah', 'e' like 'eh', 'i' like 'ee', 'o' like 'oh', and 'u' like 'oo'. Consonants have specific rules: 'c' before 'e' or 'i' sounds like 's' (ce, ci), otherwise like 'k'. 'g' before 'e' or 'i' sounds like 'h' (ge, gi), otherwise like 'g' in 'go'. 'h' is always silent. 'j' sounds like 'h' in 'hello'. 'll' and 'y' often sound like 'y' in 'yes'. 'ñ' sounds like 'ny' in 'canyon'. 'r' is rolled, and 'rr' is strongly rolled. Stress rules: words ending in vowels, 'n', or 's' are stressed on the second-to-last syllable; words ending in consonants (except 'n' or 's') are stressed on the last syllable. Accent marks (á, é, í, ó, ú) indicate exceptions to these rules. Mastering pronunciation is crucial for being understood and understanding spoken Spanish.",
  "whyItMatters": "Proper pronunciation is fundamental to Spanish communication - understanding the alphabet and pronunciation rules enables you to read, speak, and be understood correctly by native speakers.",
