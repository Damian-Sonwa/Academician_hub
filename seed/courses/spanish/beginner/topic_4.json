  "topic": "Common Nouns and Articles (el, la, los, las)",
  "detailedSummary": "Nouns in Spanish have gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural). Most nouns ending in 'o' are masculine, while most ending in 'a' are feminine, though there are exceptions. Articles must agree with the noun's gender and number. Definite articles: 'el' (masculine singular), 'la' (feminine singular), 'los' (masculine plural), 'las' (feminine plural). Indefinite articles: 'un' (masculine singular), 'una' (feminine singular), 'unos' (masculine plural), 'unas' (feminine plural). Common nouns include: family (familia), house (casa), book (libro), car (coche/carro), friend (amigo/amiga), food (comida), water (agua), school (escuela), work (trabajo). Some nouns are always masculine (el problema, el día) or always feminine (la mano, la foto). Plural formation: add 's' to vowels, 'es' to consonants. Articles are used more frequently in Spanish than English - 'Me gusta el café' (I like coffee) uses 'el', while English doesn't need 'the'. Understanding gender and articles is fundamental to Spanish grammar.",
  "whyItMatters": "Articles and noun gender are fundamental to Spanish grammar - every noun requires a gender, and articles must match, making this essential for correct Spanish communication.",
