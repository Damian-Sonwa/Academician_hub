  "topic": "Basic Adjectives and Descriptions",
  "detailedSummary": "Adjectives describe nouns and must agree with them in gender and number. Most adjectives ending in 'o' are masculine and change to 'a' for feminine: 'alto' (tall, masc.) becomes 'alta' (tall, fem.). Adjectives ending in 'e' or consonants typically don't change for gender but do change for number: 'inteligente' (intelligent) becomes 'inteligentes' (intelligent, plural). Common descriptive adjectives: grande/pequeño (big/small), bueno/malo (good/bad), nuevo/viejo (new/old), bonito/feo (pretty/ugly), fácil/difícil (easy/difficult), rico/pobre (rich/poor), joven/viejo (young/old), alto/bajo (tall/short), gordo/delgado (fat/thin), guapo/feo (handsome/ugly). Adjectives usually follow nouns in Spanish (un coche rojo - a red car), though some common ones precede (buen día - good day). To describe people: 'Soy alto' (I'm tall), 'Eres inteligente' (You're intelligent), 'Es guapa' (She's pretty). Using adjectives enables you to describe people, objects, and situations, making your Spanish more expressive and detailed.",
  "whyItMatters": "Adjectives are essential for description and expression - mastering adjective agreement and usage enables you to describe people, objects, and express opinions in Spanish.",
