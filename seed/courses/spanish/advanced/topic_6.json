  "detailedSummary": "Formal writing requires specific structures, vocabulary, and style. Academic register uses: complex sentence structures, formal connectors ('sin embargo' - however, 'no obstante' - nevertheless, 'por consiguiente' - therefore), passive voice, subjunctive extensively, precise vocabulary, avoiding contractions. Essay structure: introducción (introduction with thesis), desarrollo (body paragraphs with arguments), conclusión (conclusion summarizing points). Formal letters: 'Estimado/a Sr./Sra.' (Dear Mr./Mrs.), 'Le escribo para...' (I'm writing to...), 'Quedo a su disposición' (I remain at your disposal), 'Atentamente' (Sincerely). Academic vocabulary: 'analizar' (to analyze), 'examinar' (to examine), 'demostrar' (to demonstrate), 'concluir' (to conclude), 'sugerir' (to suggest), 'argumentar' (to argue). Citations: 'Según...' (According to...), 'Como menciona...' (As...mentions), 'En opinión de...' (In the opinion of...). Avoiding informal language, using 'usted' form, maintaining objectivity. Understanding formal writing enables academic and professional communication.",
