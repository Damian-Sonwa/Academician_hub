Common idioms: 'Estar en las nubes' (To be in the clouds - daydreaming), 'Costar un ojo de la cara' (To cost an arm and a leg), 'Echar de menos' (To miss someone), 'Tener ganas de' (To feel like/to want to), 'Dar igual' (To not matter), 'Estar hecho polvo' (To be exhausted), 'Ser pan comido' (To be a piece of cake/easy), 'Ponerse las pilas' (To get one's act together), 'Estar en el séptimo cielo' (To be on cloud nine), 'Tomar el pelo' (To pull someone's leg). Colloquialisms vary by region: Spain uses 'tío/tía' (dude), 'guay' (cool), 'flipar' (to be amazed). Latin America: 'chévere' (cool), 'bacán' (awesome), 'pibe' (kid/guy). Slang: 'joder' (damn - Spain), 'qué padre' (how cool - Mexico), 'está chévere' (it's cool - various). Understanding idioms and colloquialisms enables natural, native-like communication and cultural understanding. Context is crucial - some expressions are informal and region-specific.",
