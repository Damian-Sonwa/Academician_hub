  "topic": "Perfect Tenses: Present Perfect, Past Perfect, Future Perfect",
  "detailedSummary": "Perfect tenses combine 'haber' (to have) with past participles to express completed actions relative to different time frames. Present perfect (pretérito perfecto): 'He comido' (I have eaten) - actions completed recently or with present relevance. Formation: present of 'haber' (he, has, ha, hemos, habéis, han) + past participle. Past participles: -ar verbs → -ado (hablado), -er/-ir verbs → -ido (comido, vivido). Irregular participles: abrir → abierto, escribir → escrito, hacer → hecho, ver → visto, volver → vuelto. Past perfect (pluscuamperfecto): 'Había comido' (I had eaten) - actions completed before another past action. Formation: imperfect of 'haber' (había, habías, había, habíamos, habíais, habían) + past participle. Future perfect: 'Habré comido' (I will have eaten) - actions that will be completed by a future time. Formation: future of 'haber' (habré, habrás, habrá, habremos, habréis, habrán) + past participle. Conditional perfect: 'Habría comido' (I would have eaten). Uses: present perfect for recent past, past perfect for 'had done', future perfect for 'will have done'. Mastering perfect tenses enables precise time expression.",
