  "topic": "Passive Voice and Impersonal Expressions",
  "detailedSummary": "Passive voice emphasizes the action or object rather than the doer. Formation: 'ser' + past participle + 'por' (by): 'El libro fue escrito por Cervantes' (The book was written by Cervantes). Passive can be in any tense: 'Es escrito' (is written), 'Fue escrito' (was written), 'Será escrito' (will be written). Past participles agree with subject in gender/number. Se passive (impersonal): 'Se venden casas' (Houses are sold) - more common in Spanish. 'Se' constructions: 'Se habla español' (Spanish is spoken), 'Se prohíbe fumar' (Smoking is prohibited). Impersonal expressions: 'Se dice que...' (It's said that...), 'Se cree que...' (It's believed that...), 'Se sabe que...' (It's known that...). Other impersonal: 'Es importante que...' (It's important that...), 'Es necesario que...' (It's necessary that...), 'Es posible que...' (It's possible that...). Weather: 'Hace frío' (It's cold), 'Llueve' (It rains). Time: 'Es la una' (It's one o'clock). Understanding passive and impersonal constructions enables formal, academic expression and natural Spanish usage.",
  "whyItMatters": "Passive voice and impersonal expressions are essential for formal and academic Spanish - they're used in writing, news, and professional contexts, enabling sophisticated expression.",
