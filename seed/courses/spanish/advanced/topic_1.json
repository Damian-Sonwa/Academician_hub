  "topic": "Advanced Subjunctive: Complex Uses and Expressions",
  "detailedSummary": "Advanced subjunctive covers complex uses beyond basic emotion and doubt. Past subjunctive (imperfect subjunctive) expresses hypotheticals in the past: 'Si tuviera dinero, viajaría' (If I had money, I would travel). Formation: take third-person preterite, drop '-ron', add '-ra' or '-se' endings. Uses: 'Ojalá que...' (I hope that...), 'Como si...' (As if...), conditional sentences with 'si', expressions of time ('cuando', 'hasta que', 'después de que' with future reference). Present perfect subjunctive: 'Espero que hayas estudiado' (I hope you have studied). Pluperfect subjunctive: 'Si hubiera sabido...' (If I had known...). Adverbial clauses: 'aunque' (although), 'a menos que' (unless), 'con tal de que' (provided that), 'para que' (so that). Noun clauses after verbs of influence, emotion, doubt. Advanced expressions: 'No creo que...' (I don't think that...), 'Es posible que...' (It's possible that...), 'Dudo que...' (I doubt that...). Mastering advanced subjunctive enables expressing complex thoughts, hypotheticals, and nuanced meanings.",
  "whyItMatters": "Advanced subjunctive is essential for sophisticated Spanish - it enables expressing complex hypotheticals, nuanced thoughts, and is used constantly in formal and academic Spanish.",
