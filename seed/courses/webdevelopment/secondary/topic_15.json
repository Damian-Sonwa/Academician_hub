  "detailedSummary": "Deployment makes websites accessible on the internet by uploading files to a web server. Web hosting services provide server space and services to store and serve websites. Static hosting is for HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, while dynamic hosting supports server-side code and databases. Common hosting options include shared hosting (multiple sites on one server), VPS (Virtual Private Server), and cloud hosting (scalable services like Netlify, Vercel, GitHub Pages). Deployment typically involves: preparing files (optimizing, minifying), uploading via FTP, Git, or hosting platform interfaces, configuring domain names and DNS, and testing the live site. GitHub Pages offers free hosting for static sites. Netlify and Vercel provide easy deployment with Git integration. Domain names identify websites (like example.com), while DNS translates domain names to IP addresses. SSL certificates enable HTTPS for secure connections. Understanding deployment is essential for making websites publicly accessible and sharing work with others.",
  "whyItMatters": "Deployment is the final step in web development - understanding how to host and deploy websites is essential for making your projects accessible to the world.",
