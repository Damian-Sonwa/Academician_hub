  "topic": "Introduction to CSS Frameworks (Bootstrap)",
  "detailedSummary": "CSS frameworks provide pre-built styles and components to speed up web development. Bootstrap is one of the most popular CSS frameworks, offering a responsive grid system, pre-styled components, and utility classes. Bootstrap's grid system uses containers, rows, and columns with a 12-column layout. Components include navigation bars, buttons, cards, modals, forms, and carousels. Utility classes provide quick styling for spacing, colors, typography, and display properties. Bootstrap uses classes like btn, card, navbar, and container. The framework is mobile-first and responsive by default. To use Bootstrap, you include its CSS and JavaScript files via CDN or download. Customization can be done through CSS variables or by compiling custom builds. While frameworks speed development, understanding underlying CSS is important for customization. Bootstrap and similar frameworks enable rapid prototyping and consistent, professional-looking designs.",
