  "detailedSummary": "Version control tracks changes to files over time, allowing you to revert to previous versions and collaborate effectively. Git is the most popular version control system. A repository (repo) stores project files and their history. Basic Git workflow involves: git init (initialize repository), git add (stage changes), git commit (save changes with a message), and git status (check repository state). git log shows commit history. Branches allow parallel development - the main branch is typically the production code. git branch creates branches, git checkout switches branches, and git merge combines branches. Remote repositories (like GitHub) store code online for backup and collaboration. git remote connects to remote repos, git push uploads changes, and git pull downloads changes. .gitignore excludes files from version control. Understanding Git is essential for professional web development, enabling collaboration, backup, and organized project management.",
  "whyItMatters": "Version control with Git is essential for professional development - it enables collaboration, tracks changes, allows experimentation without risk, and is required in all modern development workflows.",
