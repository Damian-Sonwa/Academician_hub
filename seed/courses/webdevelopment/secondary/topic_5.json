  "topic": "CSS Grid and Advanced Layout Techniques",
  "detailedSummary": "CSS Grid is a powerful two-dimensional layout system that allows you to create complex layouts with rows and columns. Unlike flexbox, Grid can control both dimensions simultaneously. Grid containers use display: grid and define the layout structure. Grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows define the size of columns and rows. The fr unit represents a fraction of available space. Grid areas allow you to name sections of the grid for easier placement. Grid items can span multiple rows or columns using grid-column and grid-row. The gap property adds spacing between grid items. Grid enables responsive layouts without media queries by using auto-fit and minmax. Advanced techniques include subgrid (nesting grids), grid alignment properties, and implicit vs explicit grids. Grid is ideal for page layouts, card grids, and complex two-dimensional designs. Understanding Grid complements flexbox knowledge and provides powerful tools for modern web layout.",
  "whyItMatters": "CSS Grid is essential for creating complex, responsive layouts efficiently - it's the modern standard for two-dimensional web layouts and significantly simplifies page structure.",
