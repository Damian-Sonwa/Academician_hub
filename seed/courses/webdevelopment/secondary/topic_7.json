  "topic": "JavaScript Fundamentals: Variables, Data Types, and Operators",
  "detailedSummary": "JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to web pages. Variables store data values and are declared using var, let, or const. let and const are block-scoped and preferred in modern JavaScript, while var is function-scoped and can cause issues. JavaScript has dynamic typing, meaning variables can hold different data types. Primitive data types include numbers (integers and floats), strings (text), booleans (true/false), undefined, null, and symbols. The typeof operator identifies a variable's type. Operators perform operations on values: arithmetic (+, -, *, /, %), assignment (=, +=, -=), comparison (==, ===, !=, !==, <, >), and logical (&&, ||, !). String concatenation uses +, and template literals (backticks) allow embedded expressions. Type coercion can cause unexpected behavior, so strict equality (===) is preferred. Understanding JavaScript fundamentals is the foundation for creating interactive web applications.",
  "whyItMatters": "JavaScript is essential for creating interactive websites - without it, web pages would be static and unresponsive to user actions.",

      "question": "What is the difference between let and const in JavaScript?",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "There is no difference",
        "let can be reassigned, const cannot be reassigned",
        "const is for numbers, let is for strings",
        "let is block-scoped, const is function-scoped"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "let allows variable reassignment, while const creates a constant that cannot be reassigned after declaration. Both are block-scoped."

    {
      "question": "JavaScript uses static typing, meaning you must declare a variable's type when creating it.",
      "type": "true-false",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "False. JavaScript uses dynamic typing - variables can hold any data type, and the type is determined at runtime, not declaration."

      "question": "Which operator checks for strict equality (value and type)?",

      "options": [
        "==",
        "===",
        "=",
        "!="
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "=== checks for strict equality, comparing both value and type, while == performs type coercion which can lead to unexpected results."
