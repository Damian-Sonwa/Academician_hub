  "topic": "CSS Layout: Box Model, Flexbox, and Positioning",
  "detailedSummary": "CSS layout controls how elements are positioned and arranged on a web page. The box model is fundamental: every element is a rectangular box with content, padding, border, and margin. Understanding box-sizing (content-box vs border-box) is crucial for predictable layouts. CSS positioning includes static (default), relative (offset from normal position), absolute (positioned relative to nearest positioned ancestor), fixed (positioned relative to viewport), and sticky (switches between relative and fixed). Flexbox is a one-dimensional layout method that arranges items in rows or columns. Flex containers use display: flex and control item alignment with justify-content (main axis) and align-items (cross axis). Flex properties like flex-grow, flex-shrink, and flex-basis control how items resize. Flexbox solves common layout problems like centering content, creating equal-height columns, and distributing space evenly. Understanding these layout techniques is essential for creating well-structured, visually appealing web pages.",
