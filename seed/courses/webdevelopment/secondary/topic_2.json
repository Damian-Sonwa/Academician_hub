  "topic": "HTML Fundamentals and Document Structure",
  "detailedSummary": "HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundation of all web pages, providing the structure and content. HTML documents consist of elements defined by tags, which tell browsers how to display content. The basic HTML document structure includes the DOCTYPE declaration, html element, head section (containing metadata), and body section (containing visible content). Common HTML elements include headings (h1-h6), paragraphs (p), links (a), images (img), lists (ul, ol, li), and semantic elements like header, nav, main, article, section, and footer. Attributes provide additional information about elements, such as href for links, src for images, and alt for image descriptions. HTML5 introduced semantic elements that describe the meaning of content, making websites more accessible and SEO-friendly. Proper HTML structure is essential for accessibility, search engine optimization, and maintaining clean, readable code. Understanding HTML fundamentals is the first step in creating well-structured, accessible web pages.",
  "whyItMatters": "HTML is the foundation of all websites - without proper HTML structure, web pages cannot function correctly, and poor structure leads to accessibility issues and poor user experience.",
