  "detailedSummary": "Web development is the process of creating websites and web applications that run in browsers. The web consists of three core technologies: HTML (HyperText Markup Language) for structure, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity. Websites are accessed through browsers like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari using URLs (Uniform Resource Locators). The client-server model describes how browsers (clients) request web pages from servers, which respond with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. Web development can be divided into frontend (what users see and interact with) and backend (server-side logic and databases). Modern web development involves understanding how these technologies work together to create responsive, interactive websites. Development tools include text editors, browser developer tools for debugging, and version control systems. Understanding web development fundamentals is essential for creating modern websites and applications that work across different devices and browsers.",
