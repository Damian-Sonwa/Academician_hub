  "topic": "Responsive Design and Media Queries",
  "detailedSummary": "Responsive design ensures websites work well on all devices, from mobile phones to desktop computers. Media queries allow CSS to apply different styles based on device characteristics like screen width, height, orientation, and resolution. The viewport meta tag is essential for mobile devices to render pages correctly. Breakpoints are specific screen widths where the layout changes, commonly using 768px (tablets) and 1024px (desktops). Mobile-first design starts with mobile styles and adds larger screen styles with min-width media queries. Flexible units like percentages, em, rem, and viewport units (vw, vh) create fluid layouts. Flexible images use max-width: 100% to scale with containers. CSS Grid and Flexbox naturally support responsive design. Common responsive patterns include fluid grids, flexible images, and media queries. Understanding responsive design is crucial as mobile traffic exceeds desktop, and users expect websites to work seamlessly on any device.",
  "whyItMatters": "Responsive design is essential because most web traffic comes from mobile devices - websites that don't adapt to different screen sizes provide poor user experience and lose visitors.",
