  "detailedSummary": "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) controls the visual appearance and layout of web pages. CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. Selectors target elements using type selectors (element names), class selectors (.classname), ID selectors (#idname), and attribute selectors. The CSS box model describes how elements are rendered: content, padding (space inside), border, and margin (space outside). Common CSS properties include color (text color), background-color, font-family, font-size, width, height, padding, margin, and border. The cascade determines which styles apply when multiple rules target the same element, based on specificity and source order. CSS can be written inline, in a style tag, or in external stylesheets. Understanding CSS fundamentals enables you to create visually appealing, well-styled web pages that enhance user experience and communicate information effectively.",
  "whyItMatters": "CSS is essential for creating visually appealing and professional websites - without CSS, web pages would be plain, unstyled text with no visual hierarchy or design.",
