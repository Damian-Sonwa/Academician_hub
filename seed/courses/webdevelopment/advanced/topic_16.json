  "topic": "Testing: Unit Testing and Integration Testing",
  "detailedSummary": "Testing ensures code works correctly and prevents regressions. Unit tests test individual functions/components in isolation. Integration tests verify components work together. Test-driven development (TDD) writes tests before code. Jest is a popular JavaScript testing framework. Test structure: describe() groups tests, it()/test() define test cases, expect() makes assertions. Mocking simulates dependencies. Code coverage measures how much code is tested. React Testing Library tests React components from user perspective. Supertest tests Express APIs. End-to-end (E2E) tests verify complete user flows. Testing best practices: test behavior not implementation, keep tests simple, use descriptive names, test edge cases. Continuous Integration (CI) runs tests automatically. Understanding testing enables building reliable, maintainable applications with confidence in code quality.",
  "whyItMatters": "Testing is essential for code quality and reliability - it catches bugs early, prevents regressions, and enables confident refactoring and deployment.",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Mocking simulates dependencies (like APIs or databases) to isolate the unit under test, ensuring tests are fast and don't depend on external systems."
