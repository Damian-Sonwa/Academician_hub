  "topic": "Build Tools: Webpack, Babel, and Module Bundlers",
  "detailedSummary": "Build tools transform and bundle code for production. Webpack is a module bundler that combines modules into optimized bundles. Entry points define where bundling starts. Output configures where bundles are written. Loaders transform files (Babel for JS, CSS loaders for styles). Plugins extend functionality (HTML generation, optimization). Babel transpiles modern JavaScript to compatible versions. Presets configure Babel transformations. Source maps map bundled code to original. Code splitting reduces bundle size. Tree shaking removes unused code. Development vs production builds optimize differently. Vite is a modern alternative with faster HMR (Hot Module Replacement). Parcel provides zero-configuration bundling. Understanding build tools enables creating optimized, production-ready applications that work across browsers and devices.",
  "whyItMatters": "Build tools are essential for modern development - they enable using modern JavaScript, optimize code for production, and create efficient, deployable applications.",
