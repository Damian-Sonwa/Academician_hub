  "topic": "Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises, Async/Await, and Fetch API",
  "detailedSummary": "Asynchronous JavaScript handles operations that take time (like API calls, file reading, or timers) without blocking code execution. Callbacks were the original approach but lead to callback hell. Promises represent eventual completion of async operations with states: pending, fulfilled, or rejected. Promise methods include .then() for success, .catch() for errors, and .finally() for cleanup. Promise.all() runs multiple promises in parallel. Async/await provides synchronous-looking syntax for promises, making async code more readable. The async keyword marks functions that return promises. await pauses execution until a promise resolves. Error handling uses try/catch blocks. The Fetch API makes HTTP requests and returns promises. Response methods like .json() parse data. Understanding async JavaScript is crucial for building modern web applications that interact with APIs, databases, and handle user interactions without freezing the UI.",
  "whyItMatters": "Asynchronous JavaScript is essential for modern web apps - it enables non-blocking operations, API interactions, and responsive user interfaces that don't freeze during data loading.",

        "It's faster",
        "It provides synchronous-looking syntax that's easier to read and debug",

      "explanation": "True. Promise.all() runs promises in parallel and resolves with an array of all results, but rejects immediately if any promise rejects."

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Fetch API returns a Promise that resolves to a Response object, which must be processed (e.g., with .json()) to extract the actual data."
