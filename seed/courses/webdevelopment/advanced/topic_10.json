  "topic": "State Management: Context API and Redux",
  "detailedSummary": "State management handles application data across components. Prop drilling passes data through multiple component layers, which becomes unwieldy. Context API provides a way to share data globally without prop drilling. createContext creates a context, Provider supplies values, and useContext consumes them. Context is ideal for theme, authentication, or language preferences. Redux is a predictable state container for complex applications. Redux uses a single store containing all state. Actions describe state changes. Reducers are pure functions that update state. The store dispatches actions to reducers. useSelector accesses state, useDispatch dispatches actions. Redux Toolkit simplifies Redux setup. Middleware like Redux Thunk handles async operations. When to use Context vs Redux: Context for simple global state, Redux for complex state with time-travel debugging. Understanding state management enables building scalable applications with organized data flow.",
