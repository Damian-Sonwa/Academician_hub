  "topic": "Advanced DOM Manipulation and Performance Optimization",
  "detailedSummary": "Advanced DOM techniques improve performance and enable complex interactions. DocumentFragment batches DOM operations to reduce reflows. Cloning nodes with cloneNode() avoids recreating elements. requestAnimationFrame() optimizes animations for smooth 60fps rendering. Debouncing and throttling limit function execution frequency for performance. Virtual scrolling renders only visible items. Event delegation reduces listeners by attaching one to a parent. Intersection Observer API efficiently detects element visibility. MutationObserver watches for DOM changes. Performance optimization includes: minimizing DOM queries (cache selectors), batching DOM updates, using CSS transforms for animations (GPU-accelerated), avoiding forced synchronous layouts, and lazy loading content. Memory leaks occur from orphaned event listeners or circular references. Profiling tools identify performance bottlenecks. Understanding advanced DOM techniques enables building fast, responsive web applications that handle large datasets and complex interactions efficiently.",
  "whyItMatters": "Performance optimization is critical for user experience - slow, laggy websites drive users away, while optimized DOM manipulation creates smooth, responsive applications.",

      "question": "What is the main advantage of using DocumentFragment?",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "It's faster than regular elements",
        "It batches DOM operations to reduce reflows and improve performance",
        "It replaces the DOM",
        "It only works with animations"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "DocumentFragment allows batching multiple DOM operations, reducing reflows and repaints, which significantly improves performance when making many changes."

    {
      "question": "requestAnimationFrame() synchronizes animations with the browser's repaint cycle for smooth 60fps rendering.",
      "type": "true-false",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "True. requestAnimationFrame() schedules animations to run before the next repaint, ensuring smooth 60fps animations that are synchronized with the browser's refresh rate."
    },
    {
      "question": "What is debouncing?",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "Removing event listeners",
        "Limiting function execution to once after a delay when events fire rapidly",
        "Speeding up animations",
        "Cloning DOM nodes"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Debouncing delays function execution until after a period of inactivity, preventing functions from firing too frequently (useful for search inputs, scroll events, etc.)."
