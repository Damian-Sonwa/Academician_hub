  "topic": "Express.js Framework and RESTful APIs",
  "detailedSummary": "Express.js is a minimal, flexible Node.js web framework that simplifies server creation. Express provides routing, middleware, templating, and more. Routes handle HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and URLs. Middleware functions execute between request and response, handling tasks like parsing, authentication, logging. app.use() applies middleware. Route parameters (:id) extract URL data. Query strings access URL parameters. Request body parsing uses express.json() or body-parser. RESTful APIs follow REST principles: resources as URLs, HTTP methods for actions, stateless communication, JSON responses. API endpoints represent resources (/users, /posts). Status codes indicate results (200 OK, 201 Created, 404 Not Found, 500 Error). CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) enables frontend-backend communication. Error handling uses middleware. Understanding Express enables building robust APIs and web servers efficiently.",
  "whyItMatters": "Express.js is the standard framework for Node.js web development - understanding Express and RESTful APIs is essential for building modern backend services and full-stack applications.",

      "options": [
        "A database",
        "Functions that execute between request and response, handling tasks like parsing and authentication",
        "A frontend framework",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Middleware functions in Express execute between receiving the request and sending the response, handling tasks like body parsing, authentication, logging, and error handling."
    },
    {
      "question": "RESTful APIs should be stateless, meaning each request contains all information needed to process it.",
      "type": "true-false",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "True. RESTful APIs are stateless - each request should contain all necessary information, and the server shouldn't rely on previous requests."
    },
    {
      "question": "What HTTP method is typically used to create a new resource in RESTful APIs?",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "GET",
        "POST",
        "PUT",
        "DELETE"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "POST is used to create new resources in RESTful APIs, while GET retrieves, PUT updates, and DELETE removes resources."
