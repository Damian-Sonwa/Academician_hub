  "detailedSummary": "Web APIs provide interfaces for browser features and external services. The Geolocation API accesses device location. The Canvas API enables drawing graphics and animations. The Web Storage API (localStorage, sessionStorage) stores data in the browser. The History API manipulates browser history for single-page applications. The Fetch API makes HTTP requests. The File API reads file contents. The Web Audio API processes audio. The WebRTC API enables real-time communication. The Intersection Observer API detects element visibility efficiently. The ResizeObserver watches element size changes. The Clipboard API accesses the clipboard. Browser APIs extend functionality: Notification API for browser notifications, Battery API for device battery status, and Device Orientation API for device movement. Understanding Web APIs enables building rich, interactive web applications that leverage browser capabilities and integrate with external services.",

      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "localStorage is faster",
        "localStorage persists until cleared, sessionStorage clears when the tab closes",
        "sessionStorage stores more data",
        "There is no difference"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "localStorage persists data until explicitly cleared, while sessionStorage data is cleared when the browser tab/window closes."

      "question": "The Fetch API can only make GET requests.",
      "type": "true-false",
      "correctAnswer": false,
      "explanation": "False. The Fetch API supports all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) by configuring the request options."

      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "Observes network requests",
        "Efficiently detects when elements enter or leave the viewport",
        "Monitors mouse movements",
        "Tracks user clicks"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Intersection Observer API efficiently detects when elements intersect with the viewport, useful for lazy loading, infinite scroll, and animations."
