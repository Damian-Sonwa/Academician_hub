  "topic": "Full-Stack Application Development",
  "detailedSummary": "Full-stack development combines frontend and backend to create complete applications. The stack includes: frontend (React, Vue, or Angular), backend (Node.js/Express), database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL), and deployment (cloud platforms). Architecture patterns: MVC separates concerns, RESTful APIs enable frontend-backend communication, microservices break applications into services. Development workflow: planning and design, setting up project structure, implementing features incrementally, testing, and deployment. Environment configuration manages different settings for development/production. API integration connects frontend to backend. Error handling provides user feedback. Logging and monitoring track application health. Deployment involves: building for production, setting up servers, configuring databases, and monitoring. DevOps practices automate deployment. Understanding full-stack development enables building complete, production-ready applications from frontend to backend.",
  "whyItMatters": "Full-stack development skills are highly valuable - understanding the complete application stack enables building end-to-end solutions and opens more career opportunities.",

        "Frontend only",
        "User interacts with frontend → Frontend calls API → Backend processes → Database stores/retrieves → Response to frontend",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Full-stack flow: user interacts with frontend, frontend makes API calls to backend, backend processes requests and interacts with database, response flows back to frontend."
