  "topic": "React Router and Navigation",
  "detailedSummary": "React Router enables single-page applications (SPAs) with client-side routing, allowing navigation without page reloads. React Router uses BrowserRouter to enable routing. Routes define URL-to-component mappings using Route components. Link components create navigation links that don't reload the page. useNavigate hook programmatically navigates. useParams extracts URL parameters. useLocation accesses current location. useSearchParams handles query strings. Nested routes create hierarchical navigation. Protected routes require authentication. Route guards redirect unauthorized users. Dynamic routes use parameters (:id). 404 pages handle unknown routes. Navigation guards prevent navigation under certain conditions. Understanding React Router enables building multi-page applications with smooth navigation and proper URL management.",
  "whyItMatters": "React Router is essential for building multi-page React applications - it enables navigation, URL management, and proper routing without page reloads, which is standard in modern web apps.",

        "It's faster",
        "It enables client-side routing without page reloads",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "useParams extracts URL parameters (like :id in /users/:id) from the current route, allowing components to access dynamic route data."
