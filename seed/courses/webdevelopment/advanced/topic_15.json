  "topic": "Web Security: XSS, CSRF, and Best Practices",
  "detailedSummary": "Web security protects applications and users from attacks. XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) injects malicious scripts into web pages. Prevention: sanitize user input, escape output, use Content Security Policy (CSP). CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) tricks users into performing unwanted actions. Prevention: CSRF tokens, SameSite cookies, verify origin. SQL Injection attacks databases through input. Prevention: parameterized queries, input validation. Authentication attacks target login systems. Prevention: strong passwords, rate limiting, account lockouts. HTTPS encrypts data in transit. Security headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Frame-Options) protect against various attacks. Input validation and sanitization prevent malicious data. Dependency vulnerabilities require regular updates. Secrets management stores API keys securely. Security best practices: principle of least privilege, defense in depth, regular updates, security audits. Understanding web security is essential for building safe, trustworthy applications.",
  "whyItMatters": "Web security is critical for protecting user data and application integrity - security vulnerabilities can lead to data breaches, financial loss, and loss of user trust.",

      "question": "What is XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)?",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "A database attack",
        "An attack that injects malicious scripts into web pages",
        "A CSS framework",
        "A JavaScript library"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "XSS is an attack where malicious scripts are injected into web pages, often through user input, and executed in other users' browsers."

      "type": "true-false",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "True. CSRF tokens are unique values included in forms that verify requests originate from the legitimate application, preventing forged requests."

        "HTML encoding"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "Parameterized queries (prepared statements) and input validation prevent SQL injection by ensuring user input is treated as data, not executable code."
