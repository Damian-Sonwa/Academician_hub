  "topic": "Progressive Web Apps (PWAs)",
  "detailedSummary": "Progressive Web Apps (PWAs) combine web and native app features. PWAs work offline using service workers that cache resources. Service workers are JavaScript files that run in the background, intercepting network requests. Caching strategies include: cache-first, network-first, stale-while-revalidate. Web App Manifests provide metadata (name, icons, theme) for app-like installation. PWAs are installable on devices. Push notifications engage users. Background sync updates data when online. Responsive design ensures mobile compatibility. HTTPS is required for service workers. Lighthouse audits PWA features. PWAs provide native-like experiences: fast loading, offline functionality, home screen installation. Understanding PWAs enables building modern web applications that compete with native apps.",
  "whyItMatters": "PWAs are the future of web applications - they provide native app experiences with web technologies, improving user engagement and enabling offline functionality.",

      "question": "PWAs require HTTPS to work because service workers only function over secure connections.",
      "type": "true-false",
      "correctAnswer": true,
      "explanation": "True. Service workers require HTTPS (except on localhost) for security reasons, as they can intercept and modify network requests."

      "question": "What is the purpose of a web app manifest?",
      "type": "multiple-choice",
      "options": [
        "To store data",

      ],
      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The web app manifest provides metadata like app name, icons, and theme colors, enabling the app to be installed on devices like a native app."
