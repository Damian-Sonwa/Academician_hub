  "topic": "JavaScript Design Patterns and Best Practices",
  "detailedSummary": "Design patterns are reusable solutions to common programming problems. The Module pattern encapsulates code and creates private scope, preventing global namespace pollution. The Singleton pattern ensures only one instance exists. Factory functions create objects without using constructors. Observer pattern allows objects to notify multiple observers of state changes. MVC (Model-View-Controller) separates data, presentation, and logic. Best practices include: avoiding global variables, using meaningful names, writing DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) code, keeping functions small and focused, handling errors properly, and writing readable code. Code organization involves modular structure, consistent formatting, and clear comments. Performance best practices include: minimizing DOM manipulation, debouncing/throttling events, lazy loading, and optimizing loops. Security practices include: validating input, sanitizing data, avoiding eval(), and using HTTPS. Understanding design patterns and best practices leads to maintainable, scalable, and professional code.",
  "whyItMatters": "Design patterns and best practices are essential for writing maintainable, scalable code that other developers can understand and work with - they're fundamental to professional software development.",

        "Creates a single instance",

      "correctAnswer": 1,
      "explanation": "The Observer pattern allows objects (subjects) to notify multiple observers (listeners) when state changes, enabling event-driven architecture."
