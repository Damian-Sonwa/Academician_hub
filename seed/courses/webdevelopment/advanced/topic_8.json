  "topic": "React Hooks and Functional Components",
  "detailedSummary": "React Hooks enable using state and lifecycle features in functional components. useState manages component state. useEffect handles side effects (API calls, subscriptions, DOM manipulation) and replaces lifecycle methods. useEffect runs after render and can have dependencies. Cleanup functions in useEffect prevent memory leaks. useContext accesses React context without prop drilling. useReducer manages complex state with reducers. useMemo memoizes expensive calculations. useCallback memoizes functions to prevent unnecessary re-renders. useRef creates mutable references that don't trigger re-renders. Custom hooks encapsulate reusable logic. Rules of hooks: only call hooks at the top level, not in loops/conditions. Functional components with hooks are preferred over class components for simpler syntax, better performance, and easier testing. Understanding hooks enables building modern React applications with clean, reusable code.",

      "explanation": "useMemo memoizes the result of expensive calculations, only recalculating when dependencies change, improving performance."
