  "topic": "Authentication and Authorization",
  "detailedSummary": "Authentication verifies user identity, while authorization determines what users can access. Common authentication methods include sessions (server-stored) and JWT (JSON Web Tokens, stateless). Password hashing uses bcrypt to store secure hashes, never plain text. JWT tokens contain user data and are signed for security. Token-based auth is stateless and scalable. Session-based auth stores session IDs server-side. Registration creates user accounts with validation. Login verifies credentials and issues tokens/sessions. Logout invalidates sessions/tokens. Password reset uses secure tokens. Authorization checks user permissions (roles, ownership). Protected routes require authentication. Middleware verifies tokens/sessions. OAuth enables third-party login (Google, GitHub). Understanding authentication and authorization is essential for securing applications and protecting user data.",
  "whyItMatters": "Authentication and authorization are critical for application security - they protect user data, enable personalized experiences, and control access to resources.",
