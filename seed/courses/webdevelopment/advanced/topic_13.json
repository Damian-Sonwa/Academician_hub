  "topic": "Database Integration: MongoDB and Mongoose",
  "detailedSummary": "Databases store and manage application data. MongoDB is a NoSQL document database that stores data as JSON-like documents. MongoDB is schema-less, flexible, and scales horizontally. Mongoose is an ODM (Object Document Mapper) for MongoDB in Node.js, providing schema validation and modeling. Mongoose schemas define document structure with types, validation, and defaults. Models are compiled schemas used to interact with collections. CRUD operations: create() inserts documents, find() queries documents, findById() finds by ID, updateOne()/updateMany() update documents, deleteOne()/deleteMany() remove documents. Queries use filters, projections, sorting, and limiting. Relationships can be embedded or referenced. Indexes improve query performance. Aggregation pipelines process data. Understanding database integration enables building data-driven applications that persist and retrieve information efficiently.",

        "NoSQL is faster",
        "MongoDB stores data as JSON-like documents, is schema-less, and more flexible than SQL",
        "SQL doesn't support queries",
        "There is no difference"
