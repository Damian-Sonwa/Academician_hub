  "topic": "Advanced Literary Theory and Criticism",
  "detailedSummary": "Literary theory provides frameworks for interpreting and analyzing literature, revealing how meaning is constructed and contested. Formalism focuses on the text itself—structure, language, literary devices—separate from historical or biographical context. New Criticism (mid-20th century) emphasized close reading and textual analysis. Structuralism examines underlying systems and patterns in literature, while post-structuralism questions fixed meanings and emphasizes ambiguity. Reader-response theory considers how readers create meaning through interaction with texts. Feminist criticism examines gender roles, power dynamics, and how literature represents or challenges patriarchal structures. Marxist criticism analyzes class relations, economic systems, and how literature reflects or critiques social structures. Postcolonial criticism explores how literature represents colonized peoples, challenges colonial narratives, and examines power, identity, and resistance. Psychoanalytic criticism applies Freudian and other psychological theories to analyze characters, symbols, and unconscious meanings. Deconstruction questions binary oppositions and reveals how texts undermine their own apparent meanings. New Historicism examines literature in historical context, seeing texts as products and producers of culture. Queer theory challenges normative assumptions about gender and sexuality. Understanding multiple theoretical approaches enables sophisticated analysis, reveals different meanings in texts, and connects literature to broader cultural, political, and social contexts. These theories are essential for advanced literary study, academic research, and understanding how literature functions in society.",
