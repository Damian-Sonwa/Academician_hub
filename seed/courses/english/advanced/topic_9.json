  "topic": "Literary Research Methods and Scholarly Writing",
  "detailedSummary": "Literary research involves systematic investigation using scholarly methods to contribute new knowledge about literature. Research methods include: archival research (examining original manuscripts, letters, historical documents), textual analysis (close reading, comparative analysis), historical research (examining historical contexts), biographical research (author's life and influences), and theoretical research (applying critical theories). Primary sources are original materials: literary texts, manuscripts, letters, diaries. Secondary sources analyze primary sources: scholarly articles, books, reviews. Tertiary sources provide overviews: encyclopedias, bibliographies. Research process involves: formulating research questions, conducting literature review (surveying existing scholarship), developing methodology, gathering evidence, analyzing findings, and presenting conclusions. Scholarly writing follows conventions: clear thesis, evidence-based arguments, engagement with existing scholarship, proper citations, and contribution to academic conversation. Research databases (JSTOR, MLA International Bibliography, Project MUSE) provide access to peer-reviewed scholarship. Digital humanities tools enable computational analysis of texts. Research ethics require: accurate representation of sources, avoiding plagiarism, acknowledging influences, and respecting intellectual property. Advanced research may involve: interdisciplinary approaches, comparative studies, and original archival discoveries. Scholarly writing demonstrates: critical thinking, research competence, and ability to contribute meaningfully to literary studies. These skills are essential for graduate study, academic careers, and advanced literary analysis.",
