  "topic": "Rhetorical Analysis: Classical and Modern Approaches",
  "detailedSummary": "Rhetorical analysis examines how texts persuade, inform, or move audiences. Classical rhetoric, developed in ancient Greece and Rome, provides foundational concepts. Aristotle's three appeals remain central: ethos (credibility/character), pathos (emotion), and logos (logic/reason). The five canons of rhetoric are: invention (finding arguments), arrangement (organizing), style (language choices), memory (techniques for recall), and delivery (presentation). Classical rhetorical figures include: metaphor, simile, alliteration, anaphora (repetition at beginning), and antithesis (contrasting ideas). Modern rhetorical analysis expands beyond speeches to analyze: written texts, visual rhetoric (images, advertisements), digital media, and multimodal compositions. Kenneth Burke's dramatistic pentad analyzes motivation: act (what happened), scene (where/when), agent (who), agency (how), and purpose (why). Feminist rhetoric examines how gender influences communication. Digital rhetoric analyzes how technology shapes persuasion. Visual rhetoric analyzes how images, layout, and design persuade. Rhetorical situation (exigence, audience, constraints) shapes all communication. Advanced rhetorical analysis requires: identifying rhetorical strategies, analyzing their effectiveness, understanding context, and evaluating how texts construct meaning and influence audiences. These skills enable sophisticated analysis of political speeches, advertisements, social media, academic arguments, and all forms of persuasive communication.",
