  "topic": "Linguistics: Language Structure and Change",
  "detailedSummary": "Linguistics is the scientific study of language, examining its structure, use, and change. Core areas include: phonetics (sound production), phonology (sound patterns), morphology (word structure), syntax (sentence structure), semantics (meaning), and pragmatics (language in context). Phonetics studies how sounds are produced physically. Phonology examines sound systems and patterns in languages. Morphology analyzes how words are formed from morphemes (smallest meaningful units). Syntax studies sentence structure and grammar rules. Semantics explores meaning at word and sentence levels. Pragmatics examines how context affects meaning. Historical linguistics traces language change over time: sound changes, grammatical evolution, and vocabulary shifts. Sociolinguistics studies language variation: dialects, registers (formal/informal), and language and identity. Psycholinguistics examines language processing and acquisition. Applied linguistics addresses language teaching, translation, and language policy. Key concepts include: prescriptive vs. descriptive grammar (rules vs. actual usage), language universals (features common to all languages), and language families (related languages). Understanding linguistics reveals how language works, how it changes, and how it shapes thought and society. It provides tools for analyzing texts, understanding language variation, and appreciating linguistic diversity. Linguistics connects to literature, education, psychology, anthropology, and computer science.",
  "whyItMatters": "Linguistics provides scientific understanding of language - essential for language teaching, translation, understanding language change, and analyzing how language shapes thought and communication.",
