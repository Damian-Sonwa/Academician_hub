  "topic": "Digital Humanities and Text Analysis",
  "detailedSummary": "Digital humanities applies computational methods to humanistic inquiry, transforming how we study literature, history, and culture. Text analysis uses computational tools to examine large collections of texts, revealing patterns impossible to detect through close reading alone. Key methods include: distant reading (analyzing large text corpora), text mining (extracting information from texts), topic modeling (identifying themes across texts), sentiment analysis (analyzing emotional tone), and network analysis (mapping relationships). Digital tools enable: searching vast archives, visualizing data, mapping geographic and temporal patterns, and analyzing language at scale. Major digital humanities projects include: digitized archives, text analysis platforms, mapping projects, and digital editions. Text encoding (TEI, XML) structures texts for computational analysis. Visualization tools create graphs, maps, and networks from data. Corpus linguistics analyzes language patterns in large text collections. Digital editions provide enhanced access to texts with annotations, variants, and multimedia. Challenges include: balancing quantitative and qualitative analysis, ensuring tools don't replace critical thinking, and addressing issues of access and representation. Digital humanities connects traditional humanistic methods with computational power, enabling new questions and discoveries. It's transforming research, teaching, and public engagement with literature and culture. Understanding digital humanities prepares students for contemporary research methods and careers combining technology and the humanities.",
  "whyItMatters": "Digital humanities transforms literary and cultural research - understanding computational methods enables new discoveries, prepares for contemporary research, and combines traditional humanistic inquiry with technological innovation.",
