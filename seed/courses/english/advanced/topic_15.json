  "topic": "Capstone: Independent Research Project",
  "detailedSummary": "The capstone project represents synthesis of advanced English studies through independent research. Students design, conduct, and present original research on a topic of their choice, demonstrating mastery of: research methods, critical analysis, scholarly writing, and contribution to academic conversation. The capstone process involves: selecting a focused research question, conducting comprehensive literature review, developing methodology, gathering and analyzing evidence, writing a substantial research paper (typically 25-40 pages), and presenting findings. Research may involve: textual analysis, archival research, theoretical application, comparative studies, or digital humanities methods. The project requires: independent work, time management, critical thinking, and ability to engage with complex scholarship. Students work with a faculty advisor who provides guidance and feedback. The capstone demonstrates: ability to conduct original research, contribute new insights, write at advanced level, and present work professionally. It may lead to: conference presentations, publication, or graduate study preparation. The capstone integrates: literary analysis, research skills, theoretical frameworks, and scholarly communication. It represents the culmination of English studies, showing readiness for graduate work, professional writing, or advanced literary analysis. Successful completion demonstrates: mastery of the discipline, ability to work independently, and contribution to knowledge in the field.",
