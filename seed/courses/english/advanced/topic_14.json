  "topic": "Literary Translation and Adaptation",
  "detailedSummary": "Literary translation transfers meaning, style, and cultural context from one language to another, requiring both linguistic skill and literary sensitivity. Translation involves complex decisions: literal vs. free translation, preserving form (meter, rhyme) vs. meaning, and handling untranslatable elements. Key challenges include: cultural references (requiring explanation or adaptation), wordplay and puns (often untranslatable), idioms and expressions, and maintaining author's voice. Translation theories range from: formal equivalence (word-for-word) to dynamic equivalence (meaning-focused) to creative translation (adapting for new audience). Adaptation transforms works across media or contexts: novels to films, plays to novels, updating classics for modern audiences. Adaptation involves: selecting what to preserve, what to change, and how to translate elements across media. Both translation and adaptation raise questions about: fidelity to original, authorial intention, cultural appropriation, and audience expectations. Major translation theorists include: Walter Benjamin (translation as form), Lawrence Venuti (foreignization vs. domestication), and Susan Bassnett (cultural translation). Translation history reveals: how works enter new cultures, how translation shapes literary canons, and how translators function as cultural mediators. Understanding translation and adaptation reveals: how literature circulates globally, how meaning changes across contexts, and how works gain new life in different forms. These processes are essential for world literature, cross-cultural understanding, and keeping classics relevant.",
  "whyItMatters": "Translation and adaptation enable literature to cross boundaries - understanding these processes reveals how meaning changes across cultures and media, and how literature gains new life in different contexts.",
