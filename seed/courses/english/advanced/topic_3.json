  "topic": "Postcolonial Literature and Theory",
  "detailedSummary": "Postcolonial literature and theory examine the cultural, political, and psychological effects of colonialism and its aftermath. Postcolonial literature emerges from formerly colonized regions (Africa, Asia, Caribbean, Latin America, Middle East) and addresses themes of identity, resistance, hybridity, and decolonization. Key concepts include: the subaltern (marginalized voices), hybridity (cultural mixing), mimicry (colonized peoples adopting colonizer's culture), and the Other (how colonizers constructed colonized peoples as different/inferior). Major postcolonial theorists include: Edward Said (Orientalism—how the West constructed the East), Frantz Fanon (psychology of colonization), Homi Bhabha (hybridity and third space), and Gayatri Spivak (Can the Subaltern Speak?). Postcolonial literature often: challenges colonial narratives, gives voice to marginalized perspectives, explores identity formation in postcolonial contexts, addresses language issues (writing in colonial languages vs. native languages), and examines power dynamics. Notable authors include: Chinua Achebe (Things Fall Apart), Salman Rushdie (Midnight's Children), Jamaica Kincaid, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o, and Arundhati Roy. Postcolonial theory critiques how knowledge, history, and literature were shaped by colonial power, questions Western assumptions, and explores how postcolonial societies negotiate identity, tradition, and modernity. Understanding postcolonial literature and theory is essential for comprehending global power relations, cultural identity, and how literature functions in decolonizing contexts.",
  "whyItMatters": "Postcolonial literature and theory reveal how colonialism shaped culture and knowledge - essential for understanding global power relations, cultural identity, and decolonizing perspectives in literature and society.",
