  "detailedSummary": "Modernism (roughly 1900-1945) and Postmodernism (mid-20th century to present) represent major shifts in literary form and philosophy. Modernism reacted against Victorian realism, experimenting with form to reflect fragmented modern experience. Characteristics include: stream-of-consciousness (interior monologue showing thoughts), fragmentation (disjointed narratives), allusiveness (references requiring knowledge), and experimentation with time and perspective. Major Modernist works: James Joyce's Ulysses (stream-of-consciousness, complex allusions), Virginia Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway (interior consciousness), T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land (fragmented, allusive poetry), and William Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury (multiple perspectives, nonlinear time). Themes include: alienation, loss of meaning, search for order, and critique of modern society. Postmodernism further challenges traditional narrative, questioning reality, truth, and authority. Characteristics include: metafiction (fiction about fiction), pastiche (mixing styles), intertextuality (references to other texts), playfulness, and skepticism about grand narratives. Major Postmodernist works: Thomas Pynchon's Gravity's Rainbow, Don DeLillo's White Noise, and Italo Calvino's experimental fiction. Postmodernism blurs boundaries between high and low culture, questions authorial authority, and emphasizes that meaning is constructed rather than discovered. Both movements reflect cultural crises: Modernism responding to World War I and industrialization; Postmodernism to World War II, consumerism, and media saturation. Understanding these movements reveals how literature responds to cultural change and experiments with form to represent complex modern experience.",
