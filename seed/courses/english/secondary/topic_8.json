  "topic": "Research Writing: Citations and Academic Format",
  "detailedSummary": "Research writing requires gathering information from sources, synthesizing ideas, and presenting findings with proper attribution. The research process involves: choosing a topic, developing research questions, finding credible sources (academic journals, books, reputable websites), evaluating source quality (authority, accuracy, objectivity, currency), taking notes, organizing information, and writing with proper citations. Academic writing follows specific formats: MLA (Modern Language Association) for humanities, APA (American Psychological Association) for social sciences, and Chicago/Turabian for history and some humanities. Each style has rules for in-text citations, reference lists, formatting, and paper structure. In-text citations give credit within the text (author-page for MLA, author-date for APA). Works Cited (MLA) or References (APA) lists provide complete publication information. Plagiarism—using others' work without credit—is academic dishonesty. Proper citation includes: direct quotations (exact words in quotation marks), paraphrases (ideas in your own words), and summaries (condensed versions). Signal phrases introduce sources ('According to Smith...'). Parenthetical citations follow quoted or paraphrased material. Research papers typically include: title page, abstract (APA), introduction with thesis, body paragraphs with evidence, conclusion, and references. Understanding citation and format ensures academic integrity, gives credit to original authors, enables readers to verify sources, and demonstrates scholarly writing competence essential for academic success.",
