  "topic": "Creative Writing: Fiction and Poetry",
  "detailedSummary": "Creative writing is the art of crafting original works of imagination, including fiction (short stories, novels) and poetry. Fiction writing involves creating believable characters, developing plots with conflict and resolution, establishing vivid settings, and using point of view effectively. Character development requires creating round, dynamic characters with motivations, flaws, and growth. Dialogue should sound natural, reveal character, and advance plot. Show, don't tell—using specific details and actions rather than stating emotions or traits directly. Plot structure follows narrative arc: exposition, inciting incident, rising action, climax, falling action, resolution. Setting creates atmosphere and can function symbolically. Point of view choices (first person, third person limited, third person omniscient) affect reader experience. Poetry writing uses line breaks, rhythm, sound devices (alliteration, assonance, rhyme), imagery, and figurative language to create meaning and emotion. Free verse doesn't follow strict meter or rhyme, while formal poetry follows patterns (sonnets, haikus, villanelles). Both fiction and poetry benefit from revision: refining language, strengthening imagery, tightening structure, and ensuring every word serves a purpose. Creative writing develops imagination, empathy, self-expression, and communication skills. It allows writers to explore human experience, experiment with language, and create art that entertains, moves, and provokes thought.",
