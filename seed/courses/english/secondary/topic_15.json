  "topic": "Academic Writing: Research Papers and Essays",
  "detailedSummary": "Academic writing follows conventions that enable clear, credible communication in scholarly contexts. Research papers present original research or synthesize existing knowledge on a topic. The process involves: choosing a focused topic, developing research questions, conducting thorough research using academic sources, organizing findings, and presenting arguments with evidence. Academic essays analyze, interpret, or argue about topics using scholarly sources. Structure typically includes: introduction (hook, context, thesis), body paragraphs (topic sentences, evidence, analysis, transitions), and conclusion (synthesis, implications, future directions). The thesis statement presents the main argument or claim, guiding the entire paper. Evidence comes from credible sources: peer-reviewed articles, academic books, primary sources, and reputable databases. Analysis explains how evidence supports claims, going beyond summary to interpret and evaluate. Academic tone is formal, objective, and precise, avoiding contractions, slang, and personal opinions (unless writing personal reflection). Third-person perspective is standard (avoiding 'I' and 'you'). Citations follow specific formats (MLA, APA, Chicago) and must be accurate and complete. Revision focuses on: clarity, coherence, argument strength, evidence quality, and proper formatting. Academic writing demonstrates critical thinking, research skills, and ability to contribute to scholarly conversation. These skills are essential for college success, graduate study, and professional research.",
