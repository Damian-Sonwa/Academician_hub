  "topic": "Writing Effective Paragraphs and Essays",
  "detailedSummary": "Effective writing requires organizing ideas into coherent paragraphs and essays. A well-structured paragraph contains a topic sentence stating the main idea, supporting sentences providing evidence and details, and a concluding sentence that reinforces or transitions. Paragraphs should focus on one main idea, maintain unity (all sentences relate to the topic), and demonstrate coherence through logical organization and transitions. Essay structure follows a clear pattern: introduction (hook, background, thesis statement), body paragraphs (each with topic sentence, evidence, analysis), and conclusion (restate thesis, summarize main points, final thought). The thesis statement is the central argument or main point, typically appearing at the end of the introduction. Body paragraphs develop the thesis using various methods: examples, statistics, anecdotes, comparisons, cause and effect, and process analysis. Transitions connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs, creating flow (however, therefore, furthermore, for example). Effective writing also requires appropriate tone (formal, informal, academic), voice (active vs. passive), and style (concise, clear, engaging). Revision involves checking organization, clarity, coherence, and correctness. Understanding paragraph and essay structure enables writers to communicate ideas clearly, persuade readers, and express complex thoughts systematically in academic, professional, and creative contexts.",
