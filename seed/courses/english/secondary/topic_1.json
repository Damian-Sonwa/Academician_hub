  "topic": "Grammar Fundamentals: Parts of Speech and Sentence Structure",
  "detailedSummary": "Grammar is the system of rules governing how words combine to form meaningful sentences. Understanding parts of speech—the eight fundamental word categories—is essential for clear communication. Nouns name people, places, things, or ideas (cat, London, freedom). Pronouns replace nouns (he, she, it, they). Verbs express actions or states of being (run, think, is, become). Adjectives modify nouns, describing qualities (red, tall, beautiful). Adverbs modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs, often ending in -ly (quickly, very, well). Prepositions show relationships (in, on, at, with, between). Conjunctions connect words, phrases, or clauses (and, but, or, because). Interjections express emotion (wow, oh, ouch). Sentence structure follows patterns: simple sentences have one independent clause, compound sentences join two independent clauses with conjunctions, complex sentences combine independent and dependent clauses, and compound-complex sentences contain multiple clauses. Subjects (who or what the sentence is about) and predicates (what the subject does or is) form the core. Understanding these fundamentals enables constructing clear, grammatically correct sentences, avoiding common errors, and expressing ideas precisely. Mastery of grammar fundamentals is the foundation for effective writing, reading comprehension, and communication in academic, professional, and personal contexts.",
