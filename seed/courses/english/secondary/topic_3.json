  "topic": "Literary Analysis: Plot, Character, and Theme",
  "detailedSummary": "Literary analysis examines how authors use literary elements to create meaning. Plot is the sequence of events in a story, typically following a structure: exposition (introduction of setting and characters), rising action (conflicts develop), climax (turning point), falling action (consequences unfold), and resolution (outcome). Conflict drives plot—internal (within a character) or external (character vs. character, nature, society, or technology). Characters are the people, animals, or entities in a story. Round characters are complex and well-developed, while flat characters are simple. Dynamic characters change throughout the story, while static characters remain the same. Characterization reveals characters through direct description, dialogue, actions, thoughts, and other characters' reactions. Theme is the central message or insight about life that the author conveys. Themes are universal truths, not single words but complete ideas (e.g., 'love conquers all' not just 'love'). Themes emerge through plot events, character development, symbols, and motifs. Setting (time and place) influences mood and can symbolize themes. Point of view (first person, third person limited, third person omniscient) shapes how readers experience the story. Analyzing these elements helps readers understand deeper meanings, appreciate authorial craft, and connect literature to human experience. Literary analysis develops critical thinking, empathy, and the ability to interpret complex texts—skills valuable in academic, professional, and personal contexts.",

    "stepByStepExplanations": [
      "**Analyzing Plot:** Identify the exposition (where/when story begins, who main characters are). Trace rising action (conflicts develop, tension increases). Locate climax (highest point of conflict). Note falling action (consequences unfold). Find resolution (how conflicts are resolved).",
      "**Character Analysis:** Determine if character is round (complex) or flat (simple). Assess if character is dynamic (changes) or static (unchanged). Examine how characterization is revealed: through direct description, dialogue, actions, thoughts, or others' reactions.",
      "**Identifying Theme:** Look for recurring ideas or messages. Consider what the story suggests about human nature, society, or life. Formulate theme as a complete statement (e.g., 'Love requires sacrifice' not just 'love')."
    ],
    "examples": [
      "**Plot Analysis:** In 'The Three Little Pigs': Exposition (pigs leave home), Rising Action (wolf attacks first two houses), Climax (wolf tries to blow down brick house), Falling Action (wolf fails), Resolution (pigs are safe).",
      "**Character Types:** Ebenezer Scrooge in 'A Christmas Carol' is round (complex personality) and dynamic (transforms from miser to generous). The Ghost of Christmas Past is flat (serves one function) and static (doesn't change).",
      "**Theme Identification:** In 'To Kill a Mockingbird,' themes include 'Prejudice harms both victims and perpetrators' and 'Courage means doing what's right despite fear.'"
