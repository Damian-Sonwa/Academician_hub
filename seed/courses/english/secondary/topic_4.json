  "topic": "Poetry Analysis: Form, Meter, and Figurative Language",
  "detailedSummary": "Poetry analysis examines how poets use form, sound, and language to create meaning and emotion. Poetic form refers to structure: stanzas (groups of lines), line length, rhyme schemes (patterns of end rhymes like ABAB, AABB), and overall organization (sonnets, haikus, free verse). Meter is the rhythmic pattern of stressed and unstressed syllables. Common meters include iambic (unstressed-stressed, like 'to-DAY'), trochaic (stressed-unstressed), anapestic (two unstressed-stressed), and dactylic (stressed-two unstressed). Scansion analyzes meter by marking stressed (/) and unstressed (u) syllables. Figurative language uses words in non-literal ways to create vivid images and deeper meanings. Similes compare using 'like' or 'as' ('as brave as a lion'). Metaphors make direct comparisons ('time is a thief'). Personification gives human qualities to non-human things ('the wind whispered'). Hyperbole uses exaggeration ('I've told you a million times'). Alliteration repeats initial consonant sounds ('silly snake'). Assonance repeats vowel sounds ('fleet feet sweep'). Onomatopoeia uses words that sound like what they mean ('buzz', 'hiss'). Symbolism uses objects to represent abstract ideas (dove = peace). Imagery appeals to senses, creating vivid mental pictures. Analyzing these elements reveals how poets craft meaning, evoke emotions, and create aesthetic experiences. Understanding poetry enhances appreciation of language, develops analytical skills, and connects readers to universal human experiences expressed through artistic language.",
