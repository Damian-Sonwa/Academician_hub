  "topic": "Critical Reading and Textual Analysis",
  "detailedSummary": "Critical reading goes beyond surface understanding to analyze, evaluate, and interpret texts deeply. It involves active engagement: questioning the text, identifying assumptions, recognizing bias, evaluating evidence, and considering multiple perspectives. Close reading examines language choices, word connotations, sentence structure, and how these create meaning. Annotation—marking texts with notes, questions, and observations—aids comprehension and analysis. Textual analysis identifies: explicit meaning (what the text directly states), implicit meaning (what is suggested or implied), author's purpose (to inform, persuade, entertain), tone (author's attitude), and point of view (perspective from which text is written). Context matters: historical period, author's background, intended audience, and cultural setting influence meaning. Recognizing rhetorical strategies helps understand how texts persuade: appeals to emotion, logic, or credibility; use of evidence; and organizational patterns. Evaluating arguments requires assessing: claim validity, evidence quality, reasoning soundness, and potential biases. Comparing texts reveals similarities, differences, and how different authors address similar themes. Synthesizing information from multiple sources builds comprehensive understanding. Critical reading develops analytical thinking, enables informed evaluation of information, and prepares readers to engage thoughtfully with texts in academic, professional, and personal contexts. These skills are essential for academic success, media literacy, and making informed decisions.",
