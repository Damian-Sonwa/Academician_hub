  "topic": "American Literature: Major Authors and Movements",
  "detailedSummary": "American literature reflects the nation's history, values, and evolving identity. The Colonial Period (1600s-1700s) featured religious writings and captivity narratives. The Revolutionary Period (late 1700s) produced political documents and Enlightenment thinking. Romanticism (early 1800s) emphasized emotion, nature, and individualism, with authors like Washington Irving, Edgar Allan Poe, and Nathaniel Hawthorne. The American Renaissance (mid-1800s) produced masterworks: Herman Melville's Moby-Dick, Walt Whitman's Leaves of Grass, and Emily Dickinson's innovative poetry. Realism (late 1800s) depicted ordinary life accurately: Mark Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, Henry James's psychological novels. Naturalism (late 1800s-early 1900s) showed deterministic forces: Stephen Crane, Theodore Dreiser. Modernism (early-mid 1900s) broke traditional forms: F. Scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby, Ernest Hemingway's minimalist style, William Faulkner's stream-of-consciousness. The Harlem Renaissance (1920s-1930s) celebrated African American culture: Langston Hughes, Zora Neale Hurston. Postmodernism (mid-late 1900s) questioned reality and authority: Thomas Pynchon, Toni Morrison. Contemporary literature (late 1900s-present) explores diverse voices and identities. Major themes include: the American Dream, individualism vs. community, race and identity, nature and wilderness, and the search for meaning. Understanding American literature provides insight into American culture, history, and the ongoing conversation about what it means to be American.",
