  "detailedSummary": "A strong vocabulary enhances communication, reading comprehension, and academic success. Effective vocabulary building involves: learning words in context (seeing how words are used), understanding word parts (roots, prefixes, suffixes), recognizing word families (related words), and using words actively in speaking and writing. Etymology—the study of word origins—reveals how words evolved and their connections. Many English words derive from Latin and Greek roots. Common prefixes include: un- (not), re- (again), pre- (before), anti- (against), and mis- (wrong). Suffixes indicate parts of speech: -tion/-sion (nouns), -ly (adverbs), -able/-ible (adjectives). Root words carry core meaning: -port- (carry), -spect- (look), -dict- (say), -graph- (write). Understanding word parts enables decoding unfamiliar words. Context clues help determine meaning: definition clues (direct explanations), example clues (illustrations), synonym clues (similar words), and antonym clues (opposites). Denotation is the dictionary definition; connotation is the emotional or cultural association. Active vocabulary (words you use) grows through practice, while passive vocabulary (words you understand) expands through reading. Vocabulary strategies include: keeping word journals, using flashcards, reading widely, playing word games, and applying new words in writing. A rich vocabulary enables precise expression, sophisticated communication, and deeper understanding of texts across all subjects.",
