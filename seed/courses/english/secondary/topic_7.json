  "topic": "British Literature: From Beowulf to Modern Times",
  "detailedSummary": "British literature spans over a millennium, reflecting England's evolving culture, language, and society. Old English literature (450-1100) includes Beowulf, an epic poem in alliterative verse. Middle English (1100-1500) produced Geoffrey Chaucer's The Canterbury Tales, written in the vernacular. The Renaissance (1500-1660) saw the flowering of English drama and poetry: William Shakespeare's plays, Edmund Spenser's The Faerie Queene, and the sonnets of Shakespeare and others. The Restoration and 18th Century (1660-1798) featured satire (Jonathan Swift, Alexander Pope), the novel's emergence (Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, Samuel Richardson's Pamela), and neoclassical ideals. Romanticism (1798-1832) emphasized emotion and nature: William Wordsworth, Samuel Taylor Coleridge, Lord Byron, Percy Bysshe Shelley, John Keats, and Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. The Victorian Era (1832-1901) produced great novels: Charles Dickens's social critiques, the Brontë sisters' gothic romances, George Eliot's psychological realism. Modernism (1900-1945) broke traditional forms: Virginia Woolf's stream-of-consciousness, James Joyce's experimental techniques, T.S. Eliot's The Waste Land. Post-war literature (1945-present) includes diverse voices: George Orwell's dystopian visions, Salman Rushdie's magical realism, and contemporary authors exploring identity, postcolonial themes, and global perspectives. Major themes include: class and social change, individual vs. society, nature and industrialization, and the human condition. Understanding British literature provides insight into English history, language development, and cultural values that influenced world literature.",
  "whyItMatters": "British literature is foundational to English literary tradition - understanding its evolution provides cultural literacy, historical insight, and appreciation for the development of English language and literature.",
