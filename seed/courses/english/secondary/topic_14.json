  "topic": "Media Literacy: Analyzing News and Digital Content",
  "detailedSummary": "Media literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and create media in various forms. In our digital age, understanding how media works is crucial for informed citizenship. News analysis requires evaluating: source credibility (who produced it, what are their qualifications), bias (what perspective is presented), evidence (what facts support claims), and purpose (to inform, persuade, entertain, or sell). Recognizing different types of news helps: hard news (factual reporting), opinion pieces (editorials, columns), feature stories (in-depth human interest), and investigative journalism (deep research). Digital media includes: websites, social media posts, videos, podcasts, and online articles. Evaluating digital content involves checking: author credentials, publication dates, supporting sources, and potential misinformation. Fact-checking verifies claims using reliable sources. Recognizing propaganda techniques helps identify manipulation: emotional appeals, loaded language, bandwagon (everyone's doing it), and false dilemmas (only two options). Understanding media ownership and funding reveals potential biases. Algorithms shape what content we see online, creating filter bubbles. Critical media consumption involves: questioning sources, seeking multiple perspectives, verifying information, and recognizing one's own biases. Creating media responsibly means: fact-checking, citing sources, avoiding manipulation, and considering audience impact. Media literacy enables informed decision-making, protects against misinformation, and empowers active participation in democratic society.",
