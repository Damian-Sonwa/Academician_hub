Step 2: Evaluate against security principles: Defense in depth?, Least privilege?, Fail securely? Step 3: Identify security gaps: Missing controls, Weak controls, Architecture weaknesses. Step 4: Assess risks: What are the risks?, What's the impact? Step 5: Recommend improvements: What needs to be added?, What needs to be strengthened? Step 6: Prioritize improvements. Step 7: Create improvement plan. Step 8: Document review and recommendations.",
          "example_answer": "Architecture review: Reviewed network and application architecture. Evaluation: Defense in depth - Partial (some layers missing), Least privilege - Weak (excessive permissions), Fail securely - Good (default deny). Gaps: No network segmentation (high risk), Weak authentication (medium risk), No encryption for data at rest (high risk). Risks: Lateral movement possible, Unauthorized access risk, Data exposure risk. Recommendations: Implement network segmentation (high priority), Strengthen authentication (high priority), Encrypt data at rest (high priority). Improvement plan created, priorities set."

Step 2: Compare approaches: How do they differ?, What are the advantages/disadvantages? Step 3: Identify use cases: When to use each approach? Step 4: Design architecture for a scenario: Choose approach, Justify choice, Design implementation. Step 5: Create comparison document. Step 6: Present architecture design.",
          "example_answer": "Architecture comparison: Traditional - Perimeter-based, Good for on-premises, Weak for cloud. Zero Trust - Verify everything, Good for cloud/remote, More complex. Cloud-native - Cloud security services, Good for cloud-only, Vendor-dependent. Use cases: Traditional - On-premises networks, Zero Trust - Cloud/remote work, Cloud-native - Cloud-first organizations. Scenario: Cloud-based company → Choose Zero Trust (verify all access, no trust by default). Design: Identity verification, Device verification, Network encryption, Continuous monitoring. Architecture designed and justified."

      "summary": "Security architecture designs secure systems from the ground up. Security by design builds security into systems from the beginning. Defense in depth provides multiple layers of security protection. Security design principles (least privilege, fail securely, separation of duties) guide secure design. Network security architecture designs secure network infrastructure with firewalls, segmentation, and monitoring. Application security architecture designs secure applications with authentication, authorization, and encryption. Effective security architecture creates systems that are secure by design and resilient to attacks."
